<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="scc9e-ch05-sec-05">The logic of experimental design
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch05-p-47"><p>The randomized comparative experiment is one of the most important ideas in statistics. It is designed to allow us to draw cause-and-effect conclusions. Be sure you understand the logic:</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bluebullet" id="scc9e-ch05-list-01">
<li><div data-block_type="BL-first" id="scc9e-ch05-p-48"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> Randomization produces groups of subjects that should be similar, on average, in all respects before we apply the treatments.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-last" id="scc9e-ch05-p-49"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> Comparative design exposes all groups to similar conditions, other than the treatments they receive. This ensures that any additional lurking variables operate equally on all groups and, on average, that groups differ only in the treatments they receive.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-last" id="scc9e-ch05-p-50"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> Therefore, differences in the response variable must be due to the effects of the treatments.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-51"><p>We use chance to choose the groups in order to eliminate any systematic bias in assigning the subjects to groups. In the sickle-cell study, for example, a doctor might subconsciously assign the most seriously ill patients to the hydroxyurea group, hoping that the untested drug will help them. That would bias the experiment against hydroxyurea. Choosing an SRS of the subjects to be Group 1 gives everyone the same chance to be in either group. We expect the two groups to be similar in all respects—age, seriousness of illness, smoker or not, and so on. Chance tends to assign equal numbers of smokers to both groups, for example, even if we don’t know which subjects are smokers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-52"><p>What about the effects of lurking variables not addressed by randomization—for example, those that arise after subjects have been randomly assigned to groups? The placebo effect is such a lurking variable. Its effect occurs only after the treatments are administered to subjects. If the groups are treated at different times of the year, so that some groups are treated during flu season and others not, higher exposure of some groups to the flu could be a lurking variable. In a comparative design, we try to ensure that these lurking variables operate similarly on all groups. All groups receive some treatment in order to ensure they are equally exposed to the placebo effect. All groups receive treatment at the same time, so all experience the same exposure to the flu.</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="left" data-block_type="page_start" id="scc9e_page_102"><p>102</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-53"><p>It may not surprise you to learn that medical researchers adopted randomized comparative experiments only slowly—many doctors think they can tell “just by watching” whether a new therapy helps their patients. Not so. There are many examples of medical treatments that became popular on the basis of one-track experiments and were shown to be worth no more than a placebo when some skeptic tried a randomized comparative experiment. One search of the medical literature looked for therapies studied both by proper comparative trials and by trials with “historical controls.” A study with historical controls compares the results of a new treatment, not with a control group, but with how well similar patients have done in the past. Of the 56 therapies studied, 44 came out winners with respect to historical controls. But only 10 passed the placebo test in proper randomized comparative experiments. Expert judgment is too optimistic even when aided by comparison with past patients. At present, U.S. law requires that new drugs be shown to be both safe and effective by randomized comparative trials. There is no such requirement for other medical treatments, such as surgery. A Web search of “comparisons with historical controls” found recent studies for other medical treatments that have used historical controls.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-54"><p>There is one important caution about randomized experiments. Like random samples, they are subject to the laws of chance. Just as an SRS of voters might, by bad luck, choose people nearly all of whom have the same political party preference, a random assignment of subjects might, by bad luck, put nearly all the smokers in one group. We know that if we choose <em>large</em> random samples, it is very likely that the sample will match the population well. In the same way, if we use <em>many</em> experimental subjects, it is very likely that random assignment will produce groups that match closely. More subjects means that there is less chance variation among the treatment groups and less chance variation in the outcomes of the experiment. “Use enough subjects” joins “compare two or more treatments” and “randomize” as a basic principle of statistical design of experiments.</p></div>
