<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch06-p-51"><p>What are the effects of low-fat food labels on food consumption? Do people eat more of a snack food when the food is labeled as low fat? The answer may depend both on whether the snack food is labeled low fat and whether the label includes serving-size information. An <span data-type="termref" data-term="experiment">experiment</span> investigated this question using university staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students at a large university as subjects. Over 10 late-afternoon sessions, all subjects viewed episodes of a 60-minute, made-for-television program in a theater on campus and were asked to <span data-type="termref" data-term="rate">rate</span> the episodes. They were also told that because it was late in the afternoon, they would be given a cold 24-ounce bottle of water and a bag of granola from a respected campus restaurant called The Spice Box. They were told to enjoy as much or as little of it as they wanted. Each participant received 640 calories (160 grams) of granola in ziplock bags that were labeled with an attractive 3.25- ×- 4-inch color label. Depending on the condition randomly assigned to the subjects, the bags were labeled either “Regular Rocky Mountain Granola” or “Low-Fat Rocky Mountain Granola.” Below this, the label indicated “Contains 1 Serving” or “Contains 2 Servings,” or it provided no serving-size information. As participants left the theater, they were asked how many serving sizes they believed their package contained. Out of sight of the participants, the researchers also weighed each granola bag. Participants’ statements about serving size and the actual weights of the granola bags are the response variables.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch06-p-52"><p>This experiment has two explanatory variables: fat content, with two levels, and serving size, with three levels. The six combinations of one level of each <span data-type="termref" data-term="variable">variable</span> form six treatments. <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_6_1.html">Figure 6.1</span> shows the layout of the treatments.</p></div>

<h3>Question

</h3>
<div data-block_type="BX2-QUE" id="scc9e-ch06-p-54"><p><span data-block_type="BX2-QUE-N-ri">6.1 The perfect cup.</span> One method for brewing coffee is the pour over. Ground coffee is placed in a filter-lined dripper (a metal or ceramic basket with holes in the bottom that fits over a carafe). Hot water is poured over the coffee and allowed to drip into the carafe. A coffee shop carries three brands of dripper, each brand differing in <span data-type="termref" data-term="shape">shape</span> and the placement of holes through which the coffee drips. Some experts believe that moistening the filter with hot water before filling with grounds affects flavor, so the coffee shop plans the following experiment. For each brand of dripper, coffee is to be brewed both with the filter moistened and with the filter dry. A trained barista will brew two cups of coffee for each of the six combinations of dripper and wet/dry filter. A panel of trained tasters scores each cup for flavor on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating better flavor.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="BX2-QUE" id="scc9e-ch06-p-55"><p>What are the explanatory variables and the response variables for this experiment? Make a diagram like <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_6_1.html">Figure 6.1</span> to describe the treatments. How many treatments are there? How many cups of coffee will be brewed?</p></div>
</div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-56"><p>Experimenters often want to study the combined effects of several variables simultaneously. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase interest, but if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. An experiment similar to that in <span data-type="link" data-href="example_6_8.html">Example 8</span> will help us find out.</p></div>
