<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch08-p-246"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">8.26 A recipe for poor reliability.</span> Every month, the government releases data on “personal savings.” This number tells us how many dollars individuals saved the previous month. Savings are calculated by subtracting personal spending (an enormously large number) from personal income (another enormous number). The result is one of the government’s least reliable statistics.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch08-p-247"><p>Give a numerical example to show that small percentage changes in two very large numbers can produce a big percentage change in the difference between those numbers. A variable that is the difference between two big numbers is usually not very reliable.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch08-p-249"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">8.27 Measuring crime.</span> Crime data make headlines. We measure the amount of crime by the number of crimes committed or (better) by crime rates (crimes per 100,000 population). The FBI publishes data on crime in the United States by compiling crimes reported to police departments. The FBI data are recorded in the Uniform Crime Reporting Program and are based on reports from more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States. The National Crime Victimization Survey publishes data about crimes based on a national probability sample of about 90,000 households per year. The victim survey shows almost two times as many crimes as the FBI report. Explain why the FBI report has a large downward bias for many types of crime. (Here is a case in which bias in producing data leads to bias in measurement.)</p></div>

<h3>Question

</h3>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch08-p-250"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">8.28 Measuring crime.</span> Twice each year, the National Crime Victimization Survey asks a random sample of households whether they have been victims of crime and, if so, the details. In all, nearly 160,000 people in about 90,000 households answer these questions per year. If other people in a household are in the room while one person is answering questions, the measurement of, for example, rape and other sexual assaults could be seriously biased. Why? Would the presence of other people lead to overreporting or underreporting of sexual assaults?</p></div>

Only 69 outstanding ratings were given by the 134 readers who owned Klipsch Image S4i earphones with microphone. Describe an appropriate variable, which can be computed from these counts, to measure high satisfaction with a make of earphone. Compute the values of this variable for the Apple and Klipsch earphones. Which brand has the better high-satisfaction rating?</p></div>
