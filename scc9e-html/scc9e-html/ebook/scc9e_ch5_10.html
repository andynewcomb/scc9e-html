<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-125"><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">5.7 Exhaust is bad for your heart.</span> A <em>CNET News</em> article reported that the artery walls of people living within 100 meters of a highway thicken more than twice as fast as the average person’s. Researchers used ultrasound to measure the carotid artery wall thickness of 1483 people living near freeways in the Los Angeles area. The artery wall thickness among those living within 100 meters of a highway increased by 5.5 micrometers (roughly 1 / 20th the thickness of a human hair) each year during the three-year study, which is more than twice the progression observed in participants who did not live within this distance of a highway.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-129"><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">5.8 Birth month and health.</span> A <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> article reported that researchers at the Columbia University Department of Medicine examined records for an incredible 1.75 million patients born between 1900 and 2000 who had been treated at Columbia University Medical Center. Using statistical analysis, the researchers found that for cardiovascular disease, those born in the fall (September through December) were more protected, while those born in winter and spring (January to June) had higher risk. And because so many lives are cut short due to cardiovascular diseases, being born in the autumn was actually associated with living longer than being born in the spring. Is this conclusion the result of an experiment? Why or why not? What are the explanatory and response variables?</p>

Researchers at two universities studied this issue. In one of the studies, 65 students listened to five talks. Students were randomly assigned either a laptop or a notebook for purposes of taking notes. Assume that 33 students were assigned to use laptops and 32 longhand. Whether taking notes on a laptop or by hand in a notebook, students were instructed to use their normal note-taking strategy. Thirty minutes after the lectures, participants were tested with conceptual application questions based on the lectures. Those taking notes by hand performed better than those taking notes on a laptop.

A clinical trial studied this question with 864 people who were at risk for colon cancer.

A <em>Columbus Dispatch</em> article reported on a study, conducted by researchers at The Ohio State University, of the effects of Tylenol on emotions. Half of the volunteers in the study were randomly assigned to take acetaminophen and the other half a placebo. After allowing time for the drug to take effect, the research team showed the college students 40 images that ranged from extremely unpleasant to extremely pleasant. On the one end were things such as close-up shots of malnourished children and city blocks destroyed in a war zone. On the other were images of children playing with kittens in a park, a big pile of money, and the faces of a couple in bed together. The intensity of the response to the images was measured for each subject by asking them to respond to the question, “To what extent is this picture positive or negative” using an 11-point scale from –5 (extremely negative) to 5 (extremely positive).</p>

The two treatments are traditional surgery and a new method that does not require surgery. The records described many patients whose doctors had chosen one or the other method. The study found that patients treated by the new method were significantly more likely to die within eight years.</p></div>

To do this, she will feed each diet to 10 prematurely born infants whose parents have enrolled them in the study. She has available 10 baby girls and 10 baby boys. The researcher is concerned that baby boys may respond more favorably to the diets, so if all the baby boys were fed Diet A, the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A.</p></div>
