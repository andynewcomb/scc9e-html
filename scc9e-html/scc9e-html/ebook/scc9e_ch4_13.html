One study divided a large group of white adults into thirds at random. All were asked if they had ever used cocaine. The first group was interviewed by telephone: 21% said Yes. In the group visited at home by an interviewer, 25% said Yes. The final group was interviewed at home but answered the question on an anonymous form that they sealed in an envelope.

[doesn’t] make an exception for the [mother’s] health. . . . Do you favor or oppose this ruling . . . ?</em> Result: 47% favor; 43% oppose.</p></div>
