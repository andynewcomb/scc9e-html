One study divided a large group of white adults into thirds at random. All were asked if they had ever used cocaine. The first group was interviewed by telephone: 21% said Yes. In the group visited at home by an interviewer, 25% said Yes. The final group was interviewed at home but answered the question on an anonymous form that they sealed in an envelope. Of this group, 28% said they had used cocaine.</p></div>

The stratification is based on the dollar amount of the item and often includes 100% sampling of the largest items. One company reports 5000 accounts receivable. Of these, 100 are in amounts over $50,000; 500 are in amounts between $1000 and $50,000; and the remaining 4400 are in amounts under $1000.
