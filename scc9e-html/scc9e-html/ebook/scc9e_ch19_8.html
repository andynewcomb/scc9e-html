Suppose that this is exactly true. Choosing an adult American at random then has probability 0.2 of getting one who would identify Ronald Reagan as the greatest president. If we interview adult Americans separately, we can assume that their responses are independent. We want to know the probability that a simple random sample of 100 adult Americans will contain at least 25 who say that Ronald Reagan is the greatest U.S. president.
