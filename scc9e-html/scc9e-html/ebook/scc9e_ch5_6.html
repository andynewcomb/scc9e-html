</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch05-p-60"><p>The presence of chance variation requires us to look more closely at the logic of randomized comparative experiments. We cannot say that <em>any</em> difference in the <span data-type="termref" data-term="average">average</span> number of pain episodes between the hydroxyurea group and the <span data-type="termref" data-term="control group">control group</span> must be due to the effect of the drug. Even if both treatments are the same, there will always be some chance differences between the <span data-type="termref" data-term="individuals">individuals</span> in the control group and those in the <span data-type="termref" data-term="treatment">treatment</span> group. Randomization eliminates just the systematic differences between the groups.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="BX1-T" id="scc9e-ch05-p-61"><p>Statistical significance</p></div>
<div data-block_type="BX1-TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch05-p-62"><p>An observed effect of a size that would rarely occur by chance is called <strong><span data-type="termref" data-term="statistically significant">statistically significant</span></strong>.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-63"><p>The difference between the average number of pain episodes for <span data-type="termref" data-term="subjects">subjects</span> in the hydroxyurea group and the average for the control group was “highly statistically significant.” That means that a difference of this size would almost never happen just by chance. We do indeed have strong evidence that hydroxyurea beats a <span data-type="termref" data-term="placebo">placebo</span> in helping sickle-cell disease sufferers. You will often see the phrase “statistically significant” in reports of investigations in many fields of study. It tells you that the investigators found good “statistical” evidence for the effect they were seeking.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-64"><p>Of course, the actual results of an <span data-type="termref" data-term="experiment">experiment</span> are more important than the seal of approval given by statistical significance. The treatment group in the sickle-cell experiment had an average of 2.5 pain episodes per year as opposed to 4.5 per year in the control group. That’s a big enough difference to be important to people with the disease. A difference of 2.5 versus 2.8 would be much less interesting even if it were statistically significant.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-65"><p>How large an observed effect must be in order to be regarded as statistically significant depends on the number of subjects involved. A relatively small effect—one that might not be regarded as practically important—can be statistically significant if the size of the study is large. Thus, in the sickle-cell experiment, an average of 2.50 pain episodes per year versus 2.51 per year in the control group could be statistically significant if the number of subjects involved is sufficiently large. For a very large number of subjects, the average number of pain episodes per year should be almost the same if differences are due only to chance. It is also true that a very large effect may not be statistically significant. If the number of subjects in an experiment is small, it may be possible to observe large effects simply by chance. We will discuss these issues more fully in Parts III and IV.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch05-p-66"><p>Thus, in assessing statistical significance, it is helpful to know the magnitude of the observed effect and the number of subjects. Perhaps a better term than “statistically significant” might be “statistically dissimilar.”</p></div>
