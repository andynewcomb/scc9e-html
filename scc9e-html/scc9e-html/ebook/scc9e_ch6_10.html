<li><div data-block_type="CR-X-NL-lvl2" id="scc9e-ch06-p-130"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(b)</span> Suppose your experiment demonstrates that using high-intensity xenon lights reduces accidents. What concerns might you have about whether your experimental results will reduce accidents with cars if all bicyclists are required to use such lights? (<em>Hint</em>: To help you answer this question, consider the following example. A 1980 report by the Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that adding a center brake light to cars reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50%. These findings were the result of a randomized comparative experiment. As a result, center brake lights have been required on all cars sold since 1986. Ten years later, the Insurance Institute found only a 5% reduction in rear-end collisions. Apparently, when the study was originally carried out, center brake lights were unusual and caught the eye of following drivers. By 1996, center brake lights were common and no longer captured attention.)</p></div></li>

In the study, for 18 weeks, researchers fed a group of mice a high-fat diet on a fixed schedule (eating at the same time and for the same length of time every day). They compared these mice to three control groups: one that ate a low-fat diet on a fixed schedule, one that ate an unscheduled low-fat diet (in the quantity and frequency of its choosing), and one that ate an unscheduled high-fat diet. All four groups of mice gained weight throughout the experiment. However, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet had a lower final body weight than the mice eating an unscheduled high-fat diet. Surprisingly, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet also had a lower final body weight than the mice that ate an unscheduled low-fat diet, even though both groups consumed the same amount of calories. In addition, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet exhibited a unique metabolic state in which the fats they ingested were not stored, but rather utilized for energy at times when no food was available, such as between meals. Briefly discuss the questions that arise in using this experiment to decide the benefits of a scheduled high-fat diet for humans.</p></div>

Because ibuprofen is known to possess a wide range of anti-inflammatory actions, it was hypothesized that it might help in the prevention of atherosclerotic lesion development. Both a low-cholesterol and a high-cholesterol diet were used, as the extent of atherosclerosis is also affected by diet. Thirty-two New Zealand rabbits served as subjects in the experiment and, after three months, the percentage of the surface covered by atherosclerotic plaques in a region of the aorta was evaluated. Although ibuprofen did suppress the expression of a gene thought to be related to atherosclerosis, it was not shown to have an effect on the extent of fat-induced atherosclerotic lesions.</p></div>

In an experiment, 20 subjects interested in purchasing a new rug are recruited. They are told that the price of a rug in a certain store was advertised at $500.

Two fonts, Impact and Sketchflow Print, were used. These fonts were shown in a previous study to differ in their perceived naturalness, but otherwise were rated similarly on factors such as readability and likeability. Images of two identical packages, differing only in the font used, were available to be presented to the subjects. Participants read statements such as, “This product is healthy,” “This product is wholesome,” This product is natural,” and “This product is organic.” They then rated how much they agreed with the statements on a seven-point scale with “1” indicating strong agreement and “7” indicating strong disagreement.

Response variables include students’ final-exam scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. One study compared two levels of technology for large lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) and multimedia. The individuals in the study were the eight lectures in a basic statistics course. There were four instructors, each of whom taught two lectures. Because lecturers differed, a block design was used with their lectures forming four blocks. Suppose the lectures and lecturers were as follows.</p></div>
