(<em>Hint</em>: To help you answer this question, consider the following example.

These findings were the result of a <span data-type="termref" data-term="randomized comparative experiment">randomized comparative experiment</span>. As a result, center brake lights have been required on all cars sold since 1986. Ten years later, the Insurance Institute found only a 5% reduction in rear-end collisions.

In the study, for 18 weeks, researchers fed a group of mice a high-fat diet on a fixed schedule (eating at the same time and for the same length of time every day). They compared these mice to three control groups: one that ate a low-fat diet on a fixed schedule, one that ate an unscheduled low-fat diet (in the quantity and frequency of its choosing), and one that ate an unscheduled high-fat diet. All four groups of mice gained weight throughout the experiment. However, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet had a lower final body weight than the mice eating an unscheduled high-fat diet. Surprisingly, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet also had a lower final body weight than the mice that ate an unscheduled low-fat diet, even though both groups consumed the same amount of calories. In addition, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet exhibited a unique metabolic state in which the fats they ingested were not stored, but rather utilized for energy at times when no food was available, such as between meals. Briefly discuss the questions that arise in using this experiment to decide the benefits of a scheduled high-fat diet for humans.</p></div>

Because ibuprofen is known to possess a wide range of anti-inflammatory actions, it was hypothesized that it might help in the prevention of atherosclerotic lesion development. Both a low-cholesterol and a high-cholesterol diet were used, as the extent of atherosclerosis is also affected by diet. Thirty-two New Zealand rabbits served as subjects in the experiment and, after three months, the percentage of the surface covered by atherosclerotic plaques in a region of the aorta was evaluated. Although ibuprofen did suppress the expression of a gene thought to be related to atherosclerosis, it was not shown to have an effect on the extent of fat-induced atherosclerotic lesions.</p></div>

It was hypothesized that use of a natural font, which looks more handwritten and tends to be more slanted and curved, would lead to a higher perception of product healthiness than an unnatural font. Two fonts, Impact and Sketchflow Print, were used. These fonts were shown in a previous study to differ in their perceived naturalness, but otherwise were rated similarly on factors such as readability and likeability. Images of two identical packages, differing only in the font used, were available to be presented to the subjects. Participants read statements such as, “This product is healthy,” “This product is wholesome,” This product is natural,” and “This product is organic.” They then rated how much they agreed with the statements on a seven-point scale with “1” indicating strong agreement and “7” indicating strong disagreement. Each subject’s responses were combined to create a perceived healthiness score. The researchers have 100 students available to serve as subjects.</p></div>
