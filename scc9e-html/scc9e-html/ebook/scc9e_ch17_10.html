<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch17-p0145"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">17.9 Nickels falling over.</span> You may feel that it is obvious that the probability of a head in tossing a coin is about 1-in-2 because the coin has two faces. Such opinions are not always correct. The previous exercise asked you to spin a nickel rather than toss it—that changes the probability of a head. Now try another variation. Stand a nickel on edge on a hard, flat surface. Pound the surface with your hand so that the nickel falls over. What is the probability that it falls with heads upward? Make at least 50 trials to estimate the probability of a head.</p></div>

Motor vehicle accidents killed about 32,700 people in the United States in 2013. Crashes of all scheduled air carriers worldwide, including commuter carriers, killed 266 people in 2013, and only one of these involved a U.S. air carrier.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch17-p0193"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">17.32 What probability doesn’t say.</span> The probability of a head in tossing a coin is 1-in-2. This means that as we make more tosses, the <em>proportion</em> of heads will eventually get close to 0.5. It does not mean that the <em>count</em> of heads will get close to one-half the number of tosses. To see why, imagine that the proportion of heads is 0.49 in 100 tosses, 0.493 in 1000 tosses, 0.4969 in 10,000 tosses, and 0.49926 in 100,000 tosses of a coin. How many heads came up in each set of tosses? How close is the number of heads to half the number of tosses?</p></div>
