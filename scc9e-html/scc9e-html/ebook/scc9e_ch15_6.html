Could we lengthen the lives of people in Botswana by shipping them TV sets? No. Rich nations have more TV sets than poor nations. Rich nations also have longer life expectancies because they offer better nutrition, clean water, and better health care.

<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch15-p079"><p>What causes obesity in children? Inheritance from parents, overeating, lack of physical activity, and too much television have all been named as explanatory variables.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p080"><p>The results of a study of Mexican American girls aged 9 to 12 years are typical. Researchers measured body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, for both the girls and their mothers. People with high BMI are overweight or obese. They also measured hours of television watched, minutes of physical activity, and intake of several kinds of food. The result: the girls’ BMIs were weakly correlated with physical activity (<em>r</em> = −0.18), diet, and television. The strongest correlation (<em>r</em> = 0.506) was between the BMI of daughters and the BMI of their mothers.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p081"><p>Body type is in part determined by heredity. Daughters inherit half their genes from their mothers. There is, therefore, a direct causal link between the BMI of mothers and daughters. Of course, the causal link is far from perfect. The mothers’ BMIs explain only 25.6% (that’s <span data-math="math_1"></span> again) of the variation among the daughters’ BMIs. Other factors, some measured in the study and others not measured, also influence BMI. <em>Even when direct causation is present, it is rarely a complete explanation of an association between two variables</em>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p083"><p>Can we use <span data-math="math_2"></span> or <span data-math="math_3"></span> from <span data-type="link" data-href="example_15_7.html">Example 7</span> to say how much inheritance contributes to the daughters’ BMIs? No. Remember <em>confounding</em>. It may well be that mothers who are overweight also set an example of little exercise, poor eating habits, and lots of television. Their daughters pick up these habits to some extent, so the influence of heredity is mixed up with influences from the girls’ environment. We can’t say how much of the correlation between mother and daughter BMIs is due to inheritance.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p084"><p><span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_5.html">Figure 15.5</span> shows in outline form how a variety of underlying links between variables can explain association. The dashed line represents an observed association between the variables <span data-math="math_4"></span> and <span data-math="math_5"></span>. Some associations are explained by a <em>direct cause-and-effect</em> link between the variables. The first diagram in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_5.html">Figure 15.5</span> shows “<span data-math="math_6"></span> causes <span data-math="math_7"></span>” by an arrow running from <span data-math="math_8"></span> to <span data-math="math_9"></span>. The second diagram illustrates <em>common response</em>. The observed association between the variables <span data-math="math_10"></span> and <span data-math="math_11"></span> is explained by a lurking variable <span data-math="math_12"></span>. Both <span data-math="math_13"></span> and <span data-math="math_14"></span> change in response to changes in <span data-math="math_15"></span>. This common response creates an association even though there may be no direct causal link between <span data-math="math_16"></span> and <span data-math="math_17"></span>. The third diagram in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_5.html">Figure 15.5</span> illustrates <em>confounding</em>. Both the explanatory variable <span data-math="math_18"></span> and the lurking variable <span data-math="math_19"></span> may influence the response variable <span data-math="math_20"></span>. Variables <span data-math="math_21"></span> and <span data-math="math_22"></span> are themselves associated, so we cannot distinguish the influence of <span data-math="math_23"></span> from the influence of <span data-math="math_24"></span>. We cannot say how strong the direct effect of <span data-math="math_25"></span> on <span data-math="math_26"></span> is. In fact, it can be hard to say if <span data-math="math_27"></span> influences <span data-math="math_28"></span> at all.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p085"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="example_15_7.html">Example 7</span>, there is a causal link between the BMI of mothers and daughters. However, other factors, some measured in the study and some not measured, also influence the BMI of daughters. This is an example of confounding, illustrated in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_5.html">Figure 15.5</span>(c). The <span data-math="math_29"></span> in the figure corresponds to the BMI of the mother, the <span data-math="math_30"></span> to one of the other factors, and the <span data-math="math_31"></span> to the BMI of the daughter.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p087"><p>Both common response and confounding involve the influence of a lurking variable or variables <span data-math="math_32"></span> on the response variable <span data-math="math_33"></span>. We won’t belabor the distinction between the two kinds of relationships. Just remember that “beware the lurking variable” is good advice in thinking about relationships between variables. Here is another example of common response, in a setting where we want to do prediction.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch15-p089"><p>High scores on the SAT examinations in high school certainly do not <em>cause</em> high grades in college. The moderate association (<span data-math="math_34"></span> is about 27%) is no doubt explained by common response variables such as academic ability, study habits, and staying sober. <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_5.html">Figure 15.5</span>(b) illustrates this. In the figure, <span data-math="math_35"></span> might correspond to academic ability, <span data-math="math_36"></span> to SAT scores, and <span data-math="math_37"></span> to grades in college.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p090"><p>The ability of SAT scores to partly predict college performance doesn’t depend on causation. We need only believe that the relationship between SAT scores and college grades that we see in past years will continue to hold for this year’s high school graduates. Think once more of our fossils, where femur length predicts humerus length very well. The strong relationship is explained by common response to the overall age and size of the beasts whose fossils we now examine. <em>Prediction doesn’t require causation</em>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="BX3-TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch15-p094"><p>Do strict controls on guns, especially handguns, reduce crime? To many people, the answer must be “Yes.” More than half of all murders in the United States are committed with handguns. The U.S. murder rate (per 100,000 population) is 1.7 times that of Canada, and the rate of murders with handguns is 15 times higher. Surely guns help bad things happen. Then John Lott, a University of Chicago economist, did an elaborate statistical study using data from all 3054 counties in the United States over the 18-year period from 1977 to 1994. Lott found that as states relaxed gun laws to allow adults to carry guns, the crime rate dropped. He argued that guns reduce crime by allowing citizens to defend themselves and by making criminals hesitate.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="BX3-TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p096"><p>Lott used regression methods to determine the relationship between crime and many explanatory variables and to isolate the effect of permits to carry concealed guns after adjusting for other explanatory variables. You can find a link to a copy of Lott’s study at <span data-type="link" data-href="http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/~llou/guns.html">www2.lib.uchicago.edu/~llou/guns.html</span>.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="BX3-TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p097"><p>The resulting debate, still going on, has been loud. People feel strongly about gun control. Most reacted to Lott’s work based on whether or not they liked his conclusion. Gun supporters painted Lott as Moses revealing truth at last; opponents knew he must be both wrong and evil.</p></div>
