<h2 class="section-title"><span data-type="title" data-title-for="scc9e-ch15-sec1-007">Correlation, prediction, and big data
</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch15-p0114"><p>In 2008, researchers at Google were able to track the spread of influenza across the United States much faster than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By using computer algorithms to explore millions of online Internet searches, the researchers discovered a <span data-type="termref" data-term="correlation">correlation</span> between what people searched for online and whether they had flu symptoms. The researchers used this correlation to make their surprisingly accurate predictions.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0115"><p>Massive databases, or “big data,” that are collected by Google, Facebook, credit card companies, and others contain petabytes—or <span data-math="math_39"></span> bytes— of data and continue to grow in size. Big data allow researchers, businesses, and industry to search for correlations and patterns in data that will enable them to make accurate predictions about public health, economic trends, or consumer behavior. Using big data to make predictions is increasingly common. Big data explored with clever algorithms open exciting possibilities. Will the experience of Google become the norm?</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="left" data-block_type="page_start" id="scc9e_page_354"><p>354</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0117"><p>Proponents for big data often make the following claims for its value. First, big data include all members of a <span data-type="termref" data-term="population">population</span>, eliminating the need for statistical sampling. Second, there is no need to worry about <span data-type="termref" data-term="causation">causation</span> because correlations are all we need to know for making accurate predictions. Third, scientific and statistical theory is unnecessary because, with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0118"><p>Are these claims correct? First, as we saw in <span data-type="link" data-href="scc9e-ch03.xml">Chapter 3</span>, it is true that sampling <span data-type="termref" data-term="variability">variability</span> is reduced by increasing the <span data-type="termref" data-term="sample">sample</span> size and will become negligible with a sufficiently large sample. It is also true that there is no sampling variability when one has information on the entire population of interest. However, sampling variability is not the only source of error in statistics computed from data. <span data-type="termref" data-term="Bias">Bias</span> is another source of error and is not eliminated because the sample size is extremely large. Big data are often enormous convenience samples, the result of recording huge numbers of web searches, credit card purchases, or mobile phones pinging the nearest phone tower. This is not equivalent to having information about the entire population of interest. For example, in principle, it is possible to record every message on Twitter and use these data to draw conclusions about public opinion. However, Twitter users are not representative of the population as a whole. According to the Pew Research Internet Project, in 2013, U.S.-based users were disproportionally young, urban or suburban, and black. In other words, the large amount of data generated by Twitter users is biased when the goal is to draw conclusions about public opinion of all adults in the United States.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0119"><p>Second, it is true that correlation can be exploited for purposes of prediction even if there is no causal relation between explanatory and response variables. However, if you have no idea what is behind a correlation, you have no idea what might cause prediction to fail, especially when one exploits the correlation to extrapolate to new situations. For a few winters after their success in 2008, Google Flu Trends continued to accurately track the spread of influenza using the correlations they discovered. But during the 2012–2013 flu season, data from the CDC showed that Google’s estimate of the spread of flu-like illnesses was overstated by almost a factor of two. A possible explanation was that the news was full of stories about the flu, and this provoked Internet searches by people who were otherwise healthy. The failure to understand why search terms were correlated with the spread of flu resulted in incorrectly assuming previous correlations extrapolated into the future.</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="right" data-block_type="page_start" id="scc9e_page_355"><p>355</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0121"><p>Adding to the perception of the infallibility of big data are news reports touting successes, with few reports of the failures. The claim that theory is unnecessary because the numbers speak for themselves is misleading when all the numbers concerning successes and failures of big data are not reported. Statistical theory has much to say that can prevent data analysts from making serious errors. Providing examples of where mistakes have been made and explaining how, with proper statistical understanding and tools, those mistakes could have been avoided is an important contribution.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0122"><p>The era of big data is exciting and challenging and has opened incredible opportunities for researchers, businesses, and industry. But simply being big does not exempt big data from statistical pitfalls such as <span data-type="termref" data-term="bias">bias</span> and <span data-type="termref" data-term="extrapolation">extrapolation</span>.</p></div>
