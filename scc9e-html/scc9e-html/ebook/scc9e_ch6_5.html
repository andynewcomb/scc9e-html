<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch06-p-30"><p>A well-designed <span data-type="termref" data-term="experiment">experiment</span> tells us that changes in the <span data-type="termref" data-term="explanatory variable">explanatory variable</span> cause changes in the <span data-type="termref" data-term="response variable">response variable</span>. More exactly, it tells us that this happened for specific <span data-type="termref" data-term="subjects">subjects</span> in the specific environment of this specific experiment. No doubt we had grander things in mind. We want to proclaim that our new method of teaching math does better for high school students in general or that our new drug beats a <span data-type="termref" data-term="placebo">placebo</span> for some broad class of patients. Can we generalize our conclusions from our little group of subjects to a wider <span data-type="termref" data-term="population">population</span>?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-31"><p>The first step is to be sure that our findings are <em><span data-type="termref" data-term="statistically significant">statistically significant</span></em>, that they are too strong to often occur just by chance. That’s important, but it’s a technical detail that the study’s statistician can reassure us about. The serious threat is that the treatments, the subjects, or the environment of our experiment may not be realistic. Let’s look at some examples.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-T" id="scc9e-ch06-p-32"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 5</span> Studying frustration</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch06-p-33"><p>A psychologist wants to study the effects of failure and frustration on the relationships among members of a work team. She forms a team of students, brings them to the psychology laboratory, and has them play a game that requires teamwork. The game is rigged so that they lose regularly. The psychologist observes the students through a one-way window and notes the changes in their behavior during an evening of game playing.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch06-p-34"><p>Playing a game in a laboratory for small stakes, knowing that the session will soon be over, is a long way from working for months developing a new product that never works right and is finally abandoned by your company. Does the behavior of the students in the lab tell us much about the behavior of the team whose product failed?</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-35"><p>In <span data-type="link" data-href="example_6_5.html">Example 5</span>, the subjects (students who know they are subjects in an experiment), the <span data-type="termref" data-term="treatment">treatment</span> (a rigged game), and the environment (the psychology lab) are all unrealistic if the psychologist’s goal is to reach conclusions about the effects of frustration on teamwork in the workplace. Psychologists do their best to devise realistic experiments for studying human behavior, but lack of realism limits the ability to generalize beyond the environment and subjects in their study and, hence, the usefulness of some experiments in this area.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-T" id="scc9e-ch06-p-36"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 6</span> The effects of day care</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch06-p-37"><p>Should the government provide day care for low-income preschool children? If day care helps these children stay in school and hold good jobs later in life, the government would save money by paying less welfare and collecting more taxes, so even those who are concerned only about the cost to the government might support day care programs. The Carolina Abecedarian Project (the name suggests learning the ABCs) has followed a group of children since 1972.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch06-p-38"><p>The Abecedarian Project is an experiment involving 111 people who in 1972 were healthy but low-income black infants in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. All the infants received nutritional supplements and help from social workers. Approximately half, chosen at <span data-type="termref" data-term="random">random</span>, were also placed in an intensive preschool program. The experiment compares these two treatments. Many response variables were recorded over more than 30 years, including academic test scores, college attendance, and employment.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch06-p-39"><p>This long and expensive experiment does show that intensive day care has substantial benefits in later life. The day care in the study was intensive indeed—lots of highly qualified staff, lots of parent participation, and detailed activities starting at a very young age, all costing about $11,000 per year for each child. It’s unlikely that society will decide to offer such care to all low-income children, so the level of care in this experiment is somewhat unrealistic. The unanswered question is a big one: how good must day care be to really help children succeed in life?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-T" id="scc9e-ch06-p-40"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 7</span> Are subjects treated too well?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch06-p-41"><p>Surely medical experiments are realistic? After all, the subjects are real patients in real hospitals really being treated for real illnesses.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch06-p-42"><p>Even here, there are some questions. Patients participating in medical trials get better medical care than most other patients, even if they are in the placebo group. Their doctors are specialists doing research on their specific ailment. They are watched more carefully than other patients. They are more likely to take their pills regularly because they are constantly reminded to do so. Providing “equal treatment for all” except for the experimental and control therapies translates into “provide the best possible medical care for all.” The result: ordinary patients may not do as well as the <span data-type="termref" data-term="clinical trial">clinical trial</span> subjects when the new therapy comes into general use. It’s likely that a therapy that beats a placebo in a clinical trial will beat it in ordinary medical care, but “cure rates” or other measures of success estimated from the trial may be optimistic.</p></div>

We often find several studies in different settings, with different designs, and of different quality. Can we combine their results to get an overall conclusion? That is the idea of “meta-analysis.” Of course, differences among the studies prevent us from just lumping them together. Statisticians have more sophisticated ways of combining the results. Meta-analysis has been applied to issues ranging from the effect of secondhand smoke to whether coaching improves SAT scores.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-44"><p>When experiments are not fully realistic, statistical analysis of the experimental data cannot tell us how far the results will generalize. Experimenters generalizing from students in a lab to workers in the real world must argue based on their understanding of how people function, not based just on the data. It is even harder to generalize from rats in a lab to people in the real world. This is one reason a single experiment is rarely completely convincing, despite the compelling logic of experimental design. The true scope of a new finding must usually be explored by a number of experiments in various settings.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-45"><p>A convincing case that an experiment is sufficiently realistic to produce useful information is based not on statistics, but on the experimenter’s knowledge of the subject matter of the experiment. The attention to detail required to avoid hidden <span data-type="termref" data-term="bias">bias</span> also rests on subject-matter knowledge. Good experiments combine statistical principles with understanding of a specific field of study.</p></div>
