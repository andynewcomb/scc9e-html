You can truthfully say that the Cubs have lost 6 of their last 10 games (sounds bad) or that they have won 4 of their last 5 (sounds good).</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch09-p-179"><p>The following example can also be used to make numbers sound bad or good. The median income of American households (in dollars of 2013 buying power) was $51,735 in 1990, $56,800 in 2000, and $51,939 in 2013. All three values are in dollars of 2013 buying power, which allows us to compare the numbers directly. By what percentage did household income increase between 1990 and 2013? Between 2000 and 2013? You see that you can make the income trend sound bad or good by choosing your starting point.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch09-p-180"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">9.29 Being on top also matters.</span> The previous exercise noted that median household income decreased slightly between 2000 and 2013. The top 5% of households earned $196,440 or more in 2000 and $196,000 or more in 2013. It is important to note that these amounts are both in dollars of 2013 buying power, which allows us to compare the numbers directly. By what percentage did the income of top earners decrease between 2000 and 2013? How does this compare with the percentage decrease in median household income between 2000 and 2013?</p></div>

<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch09-p-181"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">9.30 Boating safety.</span> Data on accidents in recreational boating in the U.S. Coast Guard’s <em>Recreational Boating Statistics Report</em> show that the number of deaths dropped from 676 in 2004 to 610 in 2013. The number of injuries reported also fell from 3363 in 2004 to 2678 in 2013. Why does it make sense that the number of deaths in these data is less than number of injuries? Which count (deaths or injuries) is probably more accurate?</p></div>

Is this evidence that obese people tend to earn less than other workers?</p></div>
