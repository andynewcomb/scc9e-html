You must decide whether several research proposals qualify for less rigorous review because they involve only minimal risk to subjects. Federal regulations say that “minimal risk” means the risks are no greater than “those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.” That’s vague. Which of these do you think qualifies as “minimal risk”? Explain your reasoning. </p></div>

Combinations of several powerful drugs reduce the level of HIV in the blood and at least delay illness and death from AIDS. But effectiveness depends on how damaged the patient’s immune system is and what drugs he or she has previously taken. There are strong side effects, and patients must be able to take more than a dozen pills on time every day. Because AIDS is often fatal and the combination therapy works, we might argue that it isn’t ethical to test any new treatment for AIDS that might possibly be less effective. But that might prevent discovery of better treatments. This is a strong example of the conflict between doing the best we know for patients now and finding better treatments for other patients in the future. How can we ethically test new drugs for AIDS?</p></div>

Yet AIDS is more common in parts of Africa than anywhere else. A few clinical trials are looking at ways to prevent pregnant mothers infected with HIV from passing the infection to their unborn children, a major source of HIV infections in Africa. Some people say these trials are unethical because they do not give effective AIDS drugs to their subjects, as would be required in rich nations. Others reply that the trials are looking for treatments that can work in the real world in Africa and that they promise benefits at least to the children of their subjects. What do you think?</p></div>

</h3>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-184"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.31 AIDS trials in Africa.</span> One of the most important goals of AIDS research is to find a vaccine that will protect against HIV. Because AIDS is so common in parts of Africa, that is the easiest place to test a vaccine. It is likely, however, that a vaccine would be so expensive that it could not (at least at first) be widely used in Africa. Is it ethical to test in Africa if the benefits go mainly to rich countries? The treatment group of subjects would get the vaccine, and the placebo group would later be given the vaccine if it proved effective. So the actual subjects would benefit—it is the future benefits that would go elsewhere. What do you think? Explain your answer.</p></div>

Otherwise, the possessors of poll results can use the information to their own advantage. They can act on the information, release only selected parts of it, or time the release for best effect. A candidate’s organization replies that they are paying for the poll in order to gain information for their own use, not to amuse the public. Do you favor requiring complete disclosure of political poll results? What about other private surveys, such as market research surveys of consumer tastes?</p></div>

The decennial long form was eliminated. The American Community Survey (ACS) replaced the long form in 2010 and will collect long-form-type information throughout the decade rather than only once every 10 years. The 2010 ACS asked detailed questions, for example: </p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-192"><p><em>Does this house, apartment, or mobile home have a) hot and cold piped water?; b) a flush toilet?; c) a bathtub or shower?; d) a sink or faucet?; e) a stove or range?; f) a refrigerator?; and g) telephone service from which you can both make and receive calls? Include cell phones.</em> </p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-193"><p>The form also asked for individual income in dollars, broken down by source, and whether any “physical, mental, or emotional condition” caused the respondent difficulty in “concentrating, remembering, or making decisions.”</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-194"><p>Give brief arguments for and against the use of the ACS form: the government has legitimate uses for such information, but the questions seem to invade people’s privacy.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-200"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.38 Tempting subjects.</span> A psychologist conducts the following experiment: he measures the attitude of subjects toward cheating, then has them take a mathematics skills exam in which the subjects are tempted to cheat. Subjects are told that high scores will receive a $100.00 gift certificate and that the purpose of the experiment is to see if rewards affect performance. The exam is computer-based and multiple choice. Subjects are left alone in a room with a computer on which the exam is available and are told that they are to click on the answer they believe is correct. However, when subjects click on an answer, a small pop-up window appears with the correct answer indicated. When the pop-up window is closed, it is possible to change the answer selected. The computer records—unknown to the subjects—whether or not they change their answers after closing the pop-up window. After completing the exam, attitude toward cheating is retested.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-201"><p>Subjects who cheat tend to change their attitudes to find cheating more acceptable. Those who resist the temptation to cheat tend to condemn cheating more strongly on the second test of attitude. These results confirm the psychologist’s theory.</p></div>
