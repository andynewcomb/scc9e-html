<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-181"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.29 AIDS clinical trials.</span> Now that effective treatments for AIDS are at last available, is it ethical to test treatments that may be less effective? Combinations of several powerful drugs reduce the level of HIV in the blood and at least delay illness and death from AIDS. But effectiveness depends on how damaged the patient’s immune system is and what drugs he or she has previously taken. There are strong side effects, and patients must be able to take more than a dozen pills on time every day. Because AIDS is often fatal and the combination therapy works, we might argue that it isn’t ethical to test any new treatment for AIDS that might possibly be less effective. But that might prevent discovery of better treatments. This is a strong example of the conflict between doing the best we know for patients now and finding better treatments for other patients in the future. How can we ethically test new drugs for AIDS?</p></div>

Yet AIDS is more common in parts of Africa than anywhere else. A few clinical trials are looking at ways to prevent pregnant mothers infected with HIV from passing the infection to their unborn children, a major source of HIV infections in Africa. Some people say these trials are unethical because they do not give effective AIDS drugs to their subjects, as would be required in rich nations. Others reply that the trials are looking for treatments that can work in the real world in Africa and that they promise benefits at least to the children of their subjects. What do you think?</p></div>

</h3>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-184"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.31 AIDS trials in Africa.</span> One of the most important goals of AIDS research is to find a vaccine that will protect against HIV. Because AIDS is so common in parts of Africa, that is the easiest place to test a vaccine. It is likely, however, that a vaccine would be so expensive that it could not (at least at first) be widely used in Africa. Is it ethical to test in Africa if the benefits go mainly to rich countries? The treatment group of subjects would get the vaccine, and the placebo group would later be given the vaccine if it proved effective. So the actual subjects would benefit—it is the future benefits that would go elsewhere. What do you think? Explain your answer.</p></div>

A candidate’s organization replies that they are paying for the poll in order to gain information for their own use, not to amuse the public.

Subjects are told that high scores will receive a $100.00 gift certificate and that the purpose of the experiment is to see if rewards affect performance. The exam is computer-based and multiple choice. Subjects are left alone in a room with a computer on which the exam is available and are told that they are to click on the answer they believe is correct. However, when subjects click on an answer, a small pop-up window appears with the correct answer indicated. When the pop-up window is closed, it is possible to change the answer selected. The computer records—unknown to the subjects—whether or not they change their answers after closing the pop-up window. After completing the exam, attitude toward cheating is retested.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-201"><p>Subjects who cheat tend to change their attitudes to find cheating more acceptable.
