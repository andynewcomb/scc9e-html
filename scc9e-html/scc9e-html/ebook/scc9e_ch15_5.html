Hawaii is a high <span data-type="termref" data-term="outlier">outlier</span>, with a yearly record of 704.83 inches of rain recorded at Kukui in 1982. The correlation for all 50 states in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_4.html">Figure 15.4</span> is 0.510. If we leave out Hawaii, the correlation drops to <em>r</em> = 0.248. The solid line in the figure is the least-squares line for predicting the annual record from the 24-hour record. If we leave out Hawaii, the least-squares line drops down to the dotted line. This line is nearly flat—there is little relation between yearly and 24-hour record precipitation once we decide to ignore Hawaii.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p054"><p>The usefulness of the <span data-type="termref" data-term="regression line">regression line</span> for prediction depends on the strength of the association. That is, the usefulness of a regression line depends on the correlation between the variables. It turns out that the <em>square</em> of the correlation is the right measure.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch15-p060"><p>Look again at <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_1.html">Figure 15.1</span>. There is a lot of variation in the humerus lengths of these five fossils, from a low of 41 cm to a high of 84 cm. The scatterplot shows that we can explain almost all of this variation by looking at femur length and at the regression line. As femur length increases, it pulls humerus length up with it along the line. There is very little leftover variation in humerus length, which appears in the scatter of points about the line. Because <em>r</em> = 0.994 for these data, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = (0.994)<sup>2</sup> = 0.988. So, the variation “along the line” as femur length pulls humerus length with it accounts for 98.8% of all the variation in humerus length. The scatter of the points about the line accounts for only the remaining 1.2%. Little leftover scatter says that prediction will be accurate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p061"><p>Contrast the voting data in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_2.html">Figure 15.2</span>. There is still a straight-line relationship between the 1980 and 1984 Democratic votes, but there is also much more scatter of points about the regression line. Here, <em>r</em> = 0.704 and so <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.496. Only about half the observed variation in the 1984 Democratic vote is explained by the straight-line pattern. You would still guess a higher 1984 Democratic vote for a state that was 45% Democratic in 1980 than for a state that was only 30% Democratic in 1980. But lots of variation remains in the 1984 votes of states with the same 1980 vote. That is the other half of the total variation among the states in 1984. It is due to other factors, such as differences in the main issues in the two elections and the fact that President Reagan’s two Democratic opponents came from different parts of the country.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p062"><p>In reporting a regression, it is usual to give <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> as a measure of how successful the regression was in explaining the response. When you see a correlation, square it to get a better feel for the strength of the association. Perfect correlation a <em>r</em> = −1 or <em>r</em> = 1) means the points lie exactly on a line. Then, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 1 and all of the variation in one <span data-type="termref" data-term="variable">variable</span> is accounted for by the straight-line relationship with the other variable. If <em>r</em> = −0.7 or <em>r</em> = 0.7, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.49 and about half the variation is accounted for by the straight-line relationship. In the <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> scale, correlation ±0.7 is about halfway between 0 and ±1.</p></div>

But Stinson was ahead after absentee ballots were counted by the Democrats, who controlled the election board. A court fight followed. The court called in a statistician, who used regression with data from past elections to predict the counts of absentee ballots from the voting-machines results. Marks’s lead of 564 votes from the machines predicted that he would get 133 more absentee votes than Stinson. In fact, Stinson got 1025 more absentee votes than Marks. Did the vote counters cheat?</p></div>
