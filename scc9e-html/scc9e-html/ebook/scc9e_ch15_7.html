</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch15-p0104"><p>Despite the difficulties, it is sometimes possible to build a strong case for causation in the absence of experiments. The evidence that smoking causes lung cancer is about as strong as nonexperimental evidence can be.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0105"><p>Doctors had long observed that most lung cancer patients were smokers. Observational studies comparing smokers and “similar” (in the sense of characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health) nonsmokers showed a strong association between smoking and death from lung cancer. Could the association be explained by lurking variables that the studies could not measure? Might there be, for example, a genetic factor that predisposes people both to nicotine addiction and to lung cancer? Smoking and lung cancer would then be positively associated even if smoking had no direct effect on the lungs. How were these objections overcome?</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="right" data-block_type="page_start" id="scc9e_page_353"><p>353</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0107"><p>Let’s answer this question in general terms. What are the criteria for establishing causation when we cannot do an experiment?</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bluebullet" id="scc9e-ch15-list-004">
<li><div data-block_type="BL-first" id="scc9e-ch15-p0108"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> <strong>The association is strong.</strong> The association between smoking and lung cancer is very strong.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p0109"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> <strong>The association is consistent.</strong> Many studies of different kinds of people in many countries link smoking to lung cancer. That reduces the chance that a lurking variable specific to one group or one study explains the association.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p0110"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> <strong>Higher doses are associated with stronger responses.</strong> People who smoke more cigarettes per day or who smoke over a longer period get lung cancer more often. People who stop smoking reduce their risk.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p0111"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> <strong>The alleged cause precedes the effect in time.</strong> Lung cancer develops after years of smoking. The number of men dying of lung cancer rose as smoking became more common, with a lag of about 30 years. Lung cancer kills more men than any other form of cancer. Lung cancer was rare among women until women began to smoke. Lung cancer in women rose along with smoking, again with a lag of about 30 years, and has now passed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among women.</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-last" id="scc9e-ch15-p0112"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> <strong>The alleged cause is plausible.</strong> Experiments with animals show that tars from cigarette smoke do cause cancer.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch15-p0113"><p>Medical authorities do not hesitate to say that smoking causes lung cancer. The U.S. Surgeon General has long stated that cigarette smoking is “the largest avoidable cause of death and disability in the United States.” The evidence for causation is overwhelming—but it is not as strong as the evidence provided by well-designed experiments.</p></div>
