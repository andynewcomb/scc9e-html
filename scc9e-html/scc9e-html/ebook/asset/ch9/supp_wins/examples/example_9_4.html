<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch09-p-21"><p>Auto manufacturers lend their dealers money to help them keep vehicles on their lots. The loans are repaid when the vehicles are sold. A Long Island auto dealer named John McNamara borrowed more than $6 billion from General Motors between 1985 and 1991. In December 1990 alone, Mr. McNamara borrowed $425 million to buy 17,000 GM vans customized by an Indiana company, allegedly for sale overseas. GM happily lent McNamara the money because he always repaid the loans.</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="right" data-block_type="page_start" id="scc9e_page_189"><p>189</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch09-p-23"><p>Let&#8217;s pause to consider the numbers, as GM should have done but didn&#8217;t. At the time GM made this loan, the entire van-customizing industry produced only about 17,000 customized vans a month. So McNamara was claiming to buy an entire month&#8217;s production. These large, luxurious, and gas-guzzling vehicles are designed for U.S. interstate highways. The recreational vehicle trade association says that only 1.35% (not quite 2800 vans) were exported in 1990. It&#8217;s not plausible to claim that 17,000 vans in a single month are being bought for export. McNamara&#8217;s claimed purchases were large even when compared with total production of vans. Chevrolet, for example, produced 100,067 full-sized vans in all of 1990.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch09-p-24"><p>Having looked at the numbers, you can guess the rest. McNamara admitted in federal court in 1992 that he was defrauding GM on a massive scale. The Indiana company was a shell company set up by McNamara, its invoices were phony, and the vans didn&#8217;t exist. McNamara borrowed vastly from GM, used most of each loan to pay off the previous loan (thus establishing a record as a good credit risk), and skimmed off a bit for himself. The bit he skimmed amounted to more than $400 million. GM set aside $275 million to cover its losses. Two executives, who should have looked at the numbers relevant to their business, were fired.</p></div>
