<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch03-p-227"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">3.21 Is a larger sample size always better?</span> In February 2004, <em>USA Today</em> conducted an online poll. Visitors to its website were asked the following question: &#8220;Should the U.S. pass a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage?&#8221; Visitors could vote by clicking a button. The results as of 3:30 <span data-block_type="small">P.M</span>. on February 25 were that 68.61% voted No and 31.39% voted Yes. A total of 63,046 votes had been recorded. Using our quick method, we find that the margin of error for 95% confidence for a sample of this size is roughly equal to four-tenths of 1 percentage point. Is it correct to say that, based on this <em>USA Today</em> online poll, we are 95% confident that 68.61% &#177;0.4% of American adults are opposed to having the United States pass a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage? Explain your answer. Be careful not to confuse your personal opinion with the statistical issues.</p></div>
