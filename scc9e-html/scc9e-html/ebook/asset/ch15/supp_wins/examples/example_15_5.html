<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch15-p060"><p>Look again at <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_1.html">Figure 15.1</span>. There is a lot of variation in the humerus lengths of these five fossils, from a low of 41 cm to a high of 84 cm. The scatterplot shows that we can explain almost all of this variation by looking at femur length and at the regression line. As femur length increases, it pulls humerus length up with it along the line. There is very little leftover variation in humerus length, which appears in the scatter of points about the line. Because <em>r</em> = 0.994 for these data, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = (0.994)<sup>2</sup> = 0.988. So, the variation &#8220;along the line&#8221; as femur length pulls humerus length with it accounts for 98.8% of all the variation in humerus length. The scatter of the points about the line accounts for only the remaining 1.2%. Little leftover scatter says that prediction will be accurate.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch15-p061"><p>Contrast the voting data in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_15_2.html">Figure 15.2</span>. There is still a straight-line relationship between the 1980 and 1984 Democratic votes, but there is also much more scatter of points about the regression line. Here, <em>r</em> = 0.704 and so <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.496. Only about half the observed variation in the 1984 Democratic vote is explained by the straight-line pattern. You would still guess a higher 1984 Democratic vote for a state that was 45% Democratic in 1980 than for a state that was only 30% Democratic in 1980. But lots of variation remains in the 1984 votes of states with the same 1980 vote. That is the other half of the total variation among the states in 1984. It is due to other factors, such as differences in the main issues in the two elections and the fact that President Reagan&#8217;s two Democratic opponents came from different parts of the country.</p></div>
