<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch18-p0178"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">18.28 The addition rule.</span> Probability rule D states: <em>If two events have no outcomes in common</em>, <em>the probability that one or the other occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities</em>. This is sometimes called the addition rule for disjoint events. A more general form of the addition rule is: <em>the probability that one or the other of two events occurs is the sum of their individual probabilities minus the probability that both occur</em>. To verify this rule, suppose you roll two casino dice as in <span data-type="link" data-href="example_18_2.html">Examples 2</span>. Refer to the outcomes in <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_18_1.html">Figure 18.1</span> to answer the following.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="CR-X-NL-lvl2" id="scc9e-ch18-p0183"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(e)</span> The addition rule says that your answer to part (d) should be equal to the sum of your answers to parts (a) and (b) minus your answer to part (c). Verify that this is the case.</p></div></li>
</ol>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch18-p0184"><p><em>Note</em>: The outcomes you were asked to count in part (c) are among those counted in parts (a) and (b). When we combine the outcomes in parts (a) and (b), we &#8220;double count&#8221; the outcomes in part (c). One of these &#8220;double counts&#8221; must be eliminated so that the combination corresponds to the outcomes in part (d). This is the reason that, in the addition rule, you subtract the probability that both occur from the sum of their individual probabilities.</p></div>
