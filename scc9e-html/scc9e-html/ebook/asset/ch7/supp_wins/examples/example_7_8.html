<div data-block_type="EXP-ni" id="scc9e-ch07-p-94"><p>How should police respond to domestic violence calls? In the past, the usual practice was to remove the offender and order the offender to stay out of the household overnight. Police were reluctant to make arrests because the victims rarely pressed charges. Women&#8217;s groups argued that arresting offenders would help prevent future violence even if no charges were filed. Is there evidence that arrest will reduce future offenses? That&#8217;s a question that experiments have tried to answer.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch07-p-95"><p>A typical domestic violence experiment compares two treatments: arrest the suspect and hold him overnight or warn the suspect and release him. When police officers reach the scene of a domestic violence call, they calm the participants and investigate. Weapons or death threats require an arrest. If the facts permit an arrest but do not require it, an officer radios headquarters for instructions. The person on duty opens the next envelope in a file prepared in advance by a statistician. The envelopes contain the treatments in <span data-type="termref" data-term="random">random</span> order. The police either arrest the suspect or warn and release him, depending on the contents of the envelope. The researchers then monitor police records and visit the victim to see if the domestic violence reoccurs.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch07-p-96"><p>The first such experiment appeared to show that arresting domestic violence suspects does reduce their future violent behavior. As a result of this evidence, arrest has become the common police response to domestic violence. </p></div>
