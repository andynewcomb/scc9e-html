<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-200"><p><span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.38 Tempting subjects.</span> A psychologist conducts the following experiment: he measures the attitude of subjects toward cheating, then has them take a mathematics skills exam in which the subjects are tempted to cheat. Subjects are told that high scores will receive a $100.00 gift certificate and that the purpose of the experiment is to see if rewards affect performance. The exam is computer-based and multiple choice. Subjects are left alone in a room with a computer on which the exam is available and are told that they are to click on the answer they believe is correct. However, when subjects click on an answer, a small pop-up window appears with the correct answer indicated. When the pop-up window is closed, it is possible to change the answer selected. The computer records&#8212;unknown to the subjects&#8212;whether or not they change their answers after closing the pop-up window. After completing the exam, attitude toward cheating is retested.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-201"><p>Subjects who cheat tend to change their attitudes to find cheating more acceptable. Those who resist the temptation to cheat tend to condemn cheating more strongly on the second test of attitude. These results confirm the psychologist&#8217;s theory.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="CR-X-NL" id="scc9e-ch07-p-202"><p>This experiment tempts subjects to cheat. The subjects are led to believe that they can cheat secretly when, in fact, they are observed. Is this experiment ethically objectionable? Explain your position.</p></div>
