<span data-block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">2.10 More instant opinion.</span> In early 2015, the <em>Drudge Report</em> ran an online poll asking participants to vote for who they preferred for the Republican presidential candidate. The choices were Jeb Bush, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum, Donald Trump, Rick Perry, Carly Florina, Marco Rubio, and Scott Walker. When the poll closed in February 2015, Scott Walker had received 199,095 votes (44%), Ted Cruz had received 58,844 votes (13%), Rand Paul had received 51,770 votes (12%), Ben Carson had received 37,945 votes (8%), Donald Trump had received 23,974 votes (5%), Sarah Palin had received 20,935 votes (5%), Jeb Bush had received 18,864 votes (4%), Marco Rubio had received 14,995 votes (3%), Rick Perry had received 6268 votes (1%), Mike Huckabee had received 6259 votes (1%), Chris Christie had received 5726 votes (1%), Rick Santorum had received 3038 votes (1%), and Carly Fiorina had received 2291 votes (1%).</p></div>
