<h3>Question

<div data-block_type="BX2-QUE" id="scc9e-ch02-p-29"><p><span data-block_type="BX2-QUE-N-ri">2.1 Sampling my class.</span> There are 20 students in my class. They are listed on my class roster in alphabetical order. There are blank rows between the first five names on the list, the second five names on the list, the third five names on the list, and the last five names on the list. Thus, the list appears as four groups of five names, each separated by blank rows.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="BX2-QUE" id="scc9e-ch02-p-30"><p>I want to take a simple random sample consisting of four of the students in my class. To do this, I select a single student from each group of five as follows. I write the numbers 1 to 5 on identical slips of paper. I mix the slips in a hat and draw one at random. I count this number of students down in the first group of five and select this student. For example, if the number selected is 3, I select the third student in the first group of five on my class roster. I replace the slip in the hat, again mix the slips, and draw a new number. The student this many down on the list in the second group is selected. I repeat this process for the remaining two groups. Every student in the class has a 1-in-5 chance of being selected when I come to his or her group. Thus, every student has the same chance of being selected. Is the sample a simple random sample? Explain.</p></div>
