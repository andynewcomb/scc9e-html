<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch02-p-16"><p>Ann Landers once asked the readers of her advice column, &#8220;If you had it to do over again, would you have children?&#8221; She received nearly 10,000 responses, almost 70% saying, &#8220;NO!&#8221; Can it be true that 70% of parents regret having children? Not at all. This is a voluntary response sample. People who feel strongly about an issue, particularly people with strong negative feelings, are more likely to take the trouble to respond. Ann Landers&#8217;s results are strongly biased&#8212;the percentage of parents who would not have children again is much higher in her sample than in the population of all parents.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch02-p-17"><p>On August 24, 2011, Abigail Van Buren (the niece of Ann Landers) revisited this question in her column &#8220;Dear Abby.&#8221; A reader asked, &#8220;I&#8217;m wondering when the information was collected and what the results of that inquiry were, and if you asked the same question today, what the majority of your readers would answer.&#8221;</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch02-p-18"><p>Ms. Van Buren responded, &#8220;The results were considered shocking at the time because the majority of responders said they would NOT have children if they had it to do over again. I&#8217;m printing your question because it will be interesting to see if feelings have changed over the intervening years.&#8221;</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch02-p-19"><p>In October 2011, Ms. Van Buren wrote that this time the majority of respondents would have children again. That is encouraging, but this was, again, a write-in poll.</p></div>
