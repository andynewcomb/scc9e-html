Researchers in Canada recruited 49 remote Hutterite farming colonies in western Canada for the study. In 25 of the colonies, all children aged 3 to 15 received flu shots in late 2008; in the 24 other colonies, they received a placebo. Which colonies received flu shots and which received the placebo was determined by randomization, and the colonies did not know whether they received the flu shots or the placebo. The researchers recorded the percentage of all children and adults in each colony who had laboratory-confirmed flu over the ensuing winter and spring.</p></div>

<li><div data-block_type="CR-X-NL-lvl2" id="scc9e-ch06-p-150"><p><span data-block_type="maker">(c)</span> By June 2009, more than 10% of all the adults and children in colonies that received the placebo had had laboratory-confirmed seasonal flu. Less than 5% of those in the colonies that received flu shots had. This difference was <span data-type="termref" data-term="statistically significant">statistically significant</span>. Explain to someone who knows no statistics what &#8220;statistically significant&#8221; means in this context.</p></div></li>
