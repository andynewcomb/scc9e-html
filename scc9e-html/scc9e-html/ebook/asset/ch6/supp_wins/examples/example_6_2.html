Give them a placebo&#8212;one study found that 42% of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their heads when they took a placebo. Another study told 13 people who were very sensitive to poison ivy that the stuff being rubbed on one arm was poison ivy. It was a placebo, but all 13 broke out in a rash. The stuff rubbed on the other arm really was poison ivy, but the subjects were told it was harmless&#8212;and only 2 of the 13 developed a rash.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch06-p-14"><p>When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the placebo effect. Others disagree (see <span data-type="link" data-href="exercise_6_31.html">Web Exercise 6.31</span>). The strength of the placebo effect in medical treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But &#8220;placebos work&#8221; is a good place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.</p></div>
