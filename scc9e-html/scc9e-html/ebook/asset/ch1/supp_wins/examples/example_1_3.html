<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch01-p-32"><p>Electric currents generate magnetic fields. So, living with electricity exposes people to magnetic fields. Living near power lines increases exposure to these fields. Really strong fields can disturb living cells in laboratory studies. What about the weaker fields we experience if we live near power lines? Some data suggested that more children in these locations might develop leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch01-p-33"><p>We can&#8217;t do experiments that deliberately expose children to magnetic fields for weeks and months at a time. It&#8217;s hard to compare cancer rates among children who happen to live in more and less exposed locations because leukemia is quite rare and locations vary a lot in many ways other than magnetic fields. It is easier to start with children who have leukemia and compare them with children who don&#8217;t. We can look at lots of possible causes&#8212;diet, pesticides, drinking water, magnetic fields, and others&#8212;to see where children with leukemia differ from those without. Some of these broad studies suggested a closer look at magnetic fields.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch01-p-34"><p>One really careful look at magnetic fields took five years and cost $5 million. The researchers compared 638 children who had leukemia and 620 who did not. They went into the homes and actually measured the magnetic fields in the children&#8217;s bedrooms, in other rooms, and at the front door. They recorded facts about nearby power lines for the family home and also for the mother&#8217;s residence when she was pregnant. Result: no evidence of more than a chance connection between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. Similar conclusions were reached by researchers at the University of Oxford in England who reviewed data from 1962 to 2008.</p></div>
