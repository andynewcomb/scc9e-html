<div data-block_type="EXP-T" id="scc9e-ch05-p-34"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 4</span> Sickle-cell anemia</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch05-p-35"><p>Sickle-cell anemia is an inherited disorder of the red blood cells that in the United States affects mostly blacks. It can cause severe pain and many complications. The National Institutes of Health carried out a clinical trial of the drug hydroxyurea for treatment of sickle-cell anemia. The subjects were 299 adult patients who had had at least three episodes of pain from sickle-cell anemia in the previous year. An episode of pain was defined to be a visit to a medical facility that lasted more than four hours for acute sickling-related pain. The measurement of the length of the visit included all time spent after registration at the medical facility, including the time spent waiting to see a physician.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch05-p-36"><p>Simply giving hydroxyurea to all 299 subjects would confound the effect of the medication with the placebo effect and other lurking variables such as the effect of knowing that you are a subject in an experiment. Instead, approximately half of the subjects received hydroxyurea, and the other half received a placebo that looked and tasted the same. All subjects were treated exactly the same (same schedule of medical checkups, for example) except for the content of the medicine they took. Lurking variables, therefore, affected both groups equally and should not have caused any differences between their average responses.</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch05-p-37"><p>The two groups of subjects must be similar in all respects before they start taking the medication. Just as in sampling, the best way to avoid bias in choosing which subjects get hydroxyurea is to allow impersonal chance to make the choice. A simple random sample of 152 of the subjects formed the hydroxyurea group; the remaining 147 subjects made up the placebo group. <span data-type="link" data-href="figure_5_2.html">Figure 5.2</span> outlines the experimental design.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch05-p-38"><p>The experiment was stopped ahead of schedule because the hydroxyurea group had many fewer pain episodes than the placebo group. This was compelling evidence that hydroxyurea is an effective treatment for sickle-cell anemia, good news for those who suffer from this serious illness.</p></div>
