</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch06-p-57"><p>Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experiments. They illustrate clearly the principles of control and randomization. However, completely randomized designs are often inferior to more elaborate statistical designs. In particular, matching the subjects in various ways can produce more precise results than simple randomization.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-58"><p>One common design that combines matching with randomization is the <strong>matched pairs design</strong>. A matched pairs design compares just two treatments. Choose pairs of subjects that are as closely matched as possible. Assign one of the treatments to each subject in a pair by tossing a coin or reading odd and even digits from <span data-type="link" data-href="table_a.html">Table A</span>. Sometimes, each “pair” in a matched pairs design consists of just one subject, who gets both treatments together (for example, each on a different arm or leg) or one after the other. Each subject serves as his or her own control. The <em>order</em> of the treatments can influence the subject’s response, so we randomize the order for each subject, again by a coin toss.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch06-p-60"><p><em>Consumers Reports</em> describes a method for comparing the effectiveness of two insect repellants. The active ingredient in one is 15% Deet. The active ingredient in the other is oil of lemon eucalyptus. Repellants are tested on several volunteers. For each volunteer, the left arm is sprayed with one of the repellants and the right arm with the other. This is a matched pairs design in which each subject compares two insect repellants. To guard against the possibility that responses may depend on which arm is sprayed, which arm receives which repellant is determined randomly. Beginning 30 minutes after applying the repellants, once every hour, volunteers put each arm in separate 8-cubic-foot cages containing 200 disease-free female mosquitoes in need of a blood meal to lay their eggs. Volunteers leave their arms in the cages for five minutes. The repellant is considered to have failed if a volunteer is bitten two or more times in a five-minute session. The response is the number of one-hour sessions until a repellant fails.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-61"><p>Matched pairs designs use the principles of comparison of treatments and randomization. However, the randomization is not complete—we do not randomly assign all the subjects at once to the two treatments. Instead, we randomize only within each matched pair. This allows matching to reduce the effect of variation among the subjects. Matched pairs are an example of <em>block designs</em>.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="BX1-TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch06-p-63"><p>A <strong>block</strong> is a group of experimental subjects that are known before the experiment to be similar in some way that is expected to affect the response to the treatments. In a <strong>block design</strong>, the random assignment of subjects to treatments is carried out separately within each block.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-64"><p>A block design combines the idea of creating equivalent treatment groups by matching with the principle of forming treatment groups at random. Blocks are another form of <em>control</em>. They control the effects of some outside variables by bringing those variables into the experiment to form the blocks. Here are some typical examples of block designs.</p></div>

Individuals may change their behavior due to the attention they are receiving from researchers rather than because of any manipulation of independent variables.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="MN-TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-66"><p>The effect was first described in the 1950s by researcher Henry A. Landsberger during his analysis of experiments conducted during the 1920s and 1930s at the Hawthorne works electric company.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="MN-TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-67"><p>The electric company had commissioned research to determine if there was a relationship between productivity and work environment.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="MN-TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-68"><p>The focus of the original studies was to determine if increasing or decreasing the amount of light workers received would have an effect on worker productivity. Employee productivity seemed to increase due to the changes but then decreased after the experiment was over. Researchers suggested that productivity increased due to attention from the research team and not because of changes to the experimental variables. Lansdberger defined the Hawthorne effect as a short-term improvement in performance caused by observing workers.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="MN-TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-69"><p>Later research into the Hawthorne effect has suggested that the original results may have been overstated. In 2009, researchers at the University of Chicago reanalyzed the original data and found that other factors also played a role in productivity and that the effect originally described was weak at best.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-first" id="scc9e-ch06-p-74"><p>A social policy experiment will assess the effect on family income of several proposed new welfare systems and compare them with the present welfare system. Because the future income of a family is strongly related to its present income, the families who agree to participate are divided into blocks of similar income levels. The families in each block are then allocated at random among the welfare systems.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-75"><p>A block is a group of subjects formed before an experiment starts. We reserve the word “treatment” for a condition that we impose on the subjects. We don’t speak of six treatments in <span data-type="link" data-href="example_6_10.html">Example 10</span> even though we can compare the responses of six groups of subjects formed by the two blocks (men, women) and the three commercials. Block designs are similar to stratified samples, which we discussed in <span data-type="link" data-href="scc9e-ch04.xml">Chapter 4</span>. Blocks and strata both group similar individuals together. We use two different names only because the idea developed separately for sampling and experiments. The advantages of block designs are the same as the advantages of stratified samples. Blocks allow us to draw separate conclusions about each block—for example, about men and women in the advertising study in <span data-type="link" data-href="example_6_10.html">Example 10</span>. Blocking also allows more precise overall conclusions because the systematic differences between men and women can be removed when we study the overall effects of the three commercials. The idea of blocking is an important additional principle of statistical design of experiments. A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important unavoidable sources of variability among the experimental subjects. Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining variation and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments.</p></div>

He made three versions of an exam. Each version had the same questions and the same set of answers, but the order of the possible answers was different for each version. The three versions were given to students in two classes having different instructors. Each class had an enrollment of 75 students. The researcher was concerned that scores might also depend on instructor, so instructor was treated as a blocking variable. Use a diagram to outline a block design for this experiment.

<div data-block_type="BX3-TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-83"><p>What about those “natural remedies”? The law allows makers of herbs, vitamins, and dietary supplements to claim without any evidence that they are safe and will help “natural conditions.” They can’t claim to treat “diseases.” Of course, the boundary between natural conditions and diseases is vague. Without any evidence whatsoever, we can claim that Dr. Moore’s Old Indiana Extract promotes healthy hearts. But without clinical trials and an okay by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we can’t claim that it reduces the risk of heart disease. No doubt lots of folks will think that “promotes healthy hearts” means the same thing as “reduces the risk of heart disease” when they see our advertisements. We also don’t have to worry about what dose of Old Indiana Extract our pills contain or about what dose might actually be toxic.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="BX3-TXT" id="scc9e-ch06-p-84"><p>Should the FDA require natural remedies to meet the same standards as prescription drugs? What does your statistical training tell you about claims not backed up by well-designed experiments? What about the fact that sometimes these natural remedies have real effects? Should that be sufficient for requiring FDA approval on natural remedies?</p></div>
