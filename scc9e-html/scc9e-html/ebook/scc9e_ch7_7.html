</span></h2>

<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch07-p-82"><p>When we move from medicine to the behavioral and social sciences, the direct risks to experimental subjects are less acute, but so are the possible benefits to the subjects. Consider, for example, the experiments conducted by psychologists in their study of human behavior.</p></div>
<div data-margin-content="left" data-block_type="page_start" id="scc9e_page_152"><p>152</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-T" id="scc9e-ch07-p-84"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 7</span> Keep out of my space</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-ni" id="scc9e-ch07-p-85"><p>Psychologists observe that people have a “personal space” and get annoyed if others come too close to them. We don’t like strangers to sit at our table in a coffee shop if other tables are available, and we see people move apart in elevators if there is room to do so. Americans tend to require more personal space than people in most other cultures. Can violations of personal space have physical, as well as emotional, effects?</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch07-p-86"><p>Investigators set up shop in a men’s public restroom. They blocked off urinals to force men walking in to use either a urinal next to an experimenter (treatment group) or a urinal separated from the experimenter (control group). Another experimenter, using a periscope from a toilet stall, measured how long the subject took to start urinating and how long he kept at it. </p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT-ni" id="scc9e-ch07-p-87"><p>This personal space experiment illustrates the difficulties facing those who plan and review behavioral studies.</p></div>
<ul data-block_type="bluebullet" id="scc9e-ch07-list-04">
<li><div data-block_type="BL-first" id="scc9e-ch07-p-88"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> There is no risk of harm to the subjects, although they would certainly object to being watched through a periscope. What should we protect subjects from when physical harm is unlikely? Possible emotional harm? Undignified situations? Invasion of privacy?</p></div></li>
<li><div data-block_type="BL-last" id="scc9e-ch07-p-89"><p><span data-block_type="maker">•</span> What about informed consent? The subjects in <span data-type="link" data-href="example_7_7.html">Example 7</span> did not even know they were participating in an experiment. Many behavioral experiments rely on hiding the true purpose of the study. The subjects would change their behavior if told in advance what the investigators were looking for. Subjects are asked to consent on the basis of vague information. They receive full information only after the experiment.</p></div></li>
</ul>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch07-p-90"><p>The “Ethical Principles” of the American Psychological Association require consent unless a study merely observes behavior in a public place. They allow deception only when it is necessary to the study, does not hide information that might influence a subject’s willingness to participate, and is explained to subjects as soon as possible. The personal space study of <span data-type="link" data-href="example_7_7.html">Example 7</span> (from the 1970s) does not meet current ethical standards.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch07-p-91"><p>We see that the basic requirement for informed consent is understood differently in medicine and psychology. Here is an example of another setting with yet another interpretation of what is ethical. The subjects get no information and give no consent. They don’t even know that an experiment may be sending them to jail for the night.</p></div>

<div data-block_type="EXP-T" id="scc9e-ch07-p-93"><p><span data-block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 8</span> Domestic violence</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-ni" id="scc9e-ch07-p-94"><p>How should police respond to domestic violence calls? In the past, the usual practice was to remove the offender and order the offender to stay out of the household overnight. Police were reluctant to make arrests because the victims rarely pressed charges. Women’s groups argued that arresting offenders would help prevent future violence even if no charges were filed. Is there evidence that arrest will reduce future offenses? That’s a question that experiments have tried to answer.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch07-p-95"><p>A typical domestic violence experiment compares two treatments: arrest the suspect and hold him overnight or warn the suspect and release him. When police officers reach the scene of a domestic violence call, they calm the participants and investigate. Weapons or death threats require an arrest. If the facts permit an arrest but do not require it, an officer radios headquarters for instructions. The person on duty opens the next envelope in a file prepared in advance by a statistician. The envelopes contain the treatments in random order. The police either arrest the suspect or warn and release him, depending on the contents of the envelope. The researchers then monitor police records and visit the victim to see if the domestic violence reoccurs.</p></div>
<div data-block_type="EXP-mid" id="scc9e-ch07-p-96"><p>The first such experiment appeared to show that arresting domestic violence suspects does reduce their future violent behavior. As a result of this evidence, arrest has become the common police response to domestic violence. </p></div>
</div></div>
<div data-block_type="TXT" id="scc9e-ch07-p-97"><p>The domestic violence experiments shed light on an important issue of public policy. Because there is no informed consent, the ethical rules that govern clinical trials and most social science studies would forbid these experiments. They were cleared by review boards because, in the words of one domestic violence researcher, “These people became subjects by committing acts that allow the police to arrest them. You don’t need consent to arrest someone.”</p></div>
