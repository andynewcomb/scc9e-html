<p id="scc9e-ch19-p03" block_type="BX4-TXT-first"><phrase block_type="BX4-H-ri">CASE STUDY</phrase> In a horse race, the starting position can affect the outcome. It is advantageous to have a starting position that is near the inside of the track. To ensure fairness, starting position is determined by a random draw before the race. All positions are equally likely, so no horse has an advantage.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p04" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">During the summer and autumn of 2007, the members of the Ohio Racing Commission noticed that one trainer appeared to have an unusually good run of luck. In 35 races, the horses of this trainer received one of the three inner positions 30 times. The number of horses in a race ranges from 6 to 10, but most of the time the number of entries is 9. Thus, for most races the chance of getting one of the three inside positions is 1-in-3.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">The Ohio Racing Commission believed that the trainer&#8217;s run of luck was too good to be true. A mathematician can show that the chance of receiving one of the three inside positions at least 30 times in 35 races is very small. The Ohio Racing Commission, therefore, suspected that cheating had occurred. But the trainer had entered horses in nearly 1000 races over several years. Perhaps it was inevitable that, at some time over the course of these nearly 1000 races, the trainer would have a string of 35 races in which he received one of the three inside positions at least 30 times. It came to the attention of the Ohio Racing Commission only because it was one of those seemingly surprising coincidences discussed in <link href="scc9e-ch17.xml">Chapter 17</link>. Perhaps the accusation of cheating was unfounded.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p06" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Calculating the probability that in a sequence of 1000 races with varying numbers of horses, there would occur a string of 35 consecutive races in which one would receive one of the three inside positions at least 30 times is very difficult. How to go about determining this probability is the subject of this chapter. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to describe how to find this probability.</p>

<p id="scc9e_page_446" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">446</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p08" block_type="TXT-ni">The probabilities of heads and tails in tossing a coin are very close to 1-in-2. In principle, these probabilities come from <em>data</em> on many coin tosses. Joe&#8217;s personal probabilities for the winner of next year&#8217;s Super Bowl come from Joe&#8217;s own <em>individual judgment</em>. What about the probability that we get a run of three straight heads somewhere in 10 tosses of a coin? We can find this probability by <em>calculation from a model</em> that describes tossing coins. That is, once we have used data to give a probability model for the random fall of coins, we don&#8217;t have to go back to the beginning every time we want the probability of a new event.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p09" block_type="TXT">The big advantage of probability models is that they allow us to calculate the probabilities of complicated events starting from an assignment of probabilities to simple events like &#8220;heads on one toss.&#8221; This is true whether the model reflects probabilities from data or personal probabilities. Unfortunately, the math needed to do probability calculations is often tough. Technology rides to the rescue: once we have a probability model, we can use a computer to <em>simulate</em> many repetitions. This is easier than math and much faster than actually running many repetitions in the real world. You might compare finding probabilities by simulation to practicing flying in a computer-controlled flight simulator. Both kinds of simulation are in wide use. Both have similar drawbacks: they are only as good as the model you start with. Flight simulators use a software model of how an airplane reacts. Simulations of probabilities use a probability model. We set the model in motion by using our old friends the random digits from <link href="table_a.html">Table A</link>.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p012" block_type="TXT">We look at simulation partly because it is how scientists and engineers really do find probabilities in complex situations. Simulations are used to develop strategies for reducing waiting times in lines to speak to a teller at banks, in lines to check in at airports, and in lines to vote during elections. Simulations are used to study the effects of changes in greenhouse gases on the climate. Simulations are used to study the effects of catastrophic events, such as the failure of a nuclear power plant, the effects on a structure of the explosion of a nuclear device, or the progression of a deadly, infectious disease in a densely populated city.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p013" block_type="TXT">We also look at simulation because simulation forces us to think clearly about probability models. We&#8217;ll do the hard part (setting up the model) and leave the easy part (telling a computer to do 10,000 repetitions) to those who really need the right probability at the end.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p015" block_type="TXT-ni">Simulation is an effective tool for finding probabilities of complex events once we have a trustworthy probability model. We can use random digits to simulate many repetitions quickly. The proportion of repetitions on which an event occurs will eventually be close to its probability, so simulation can give good estimates of probabilities. The art of simulation is best learned from a series of examples.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p030" block_type="EXP-mid">Of course, 25 repetitions are not enough to be confident that our estimate is accurate. Now that we understand how to do the simulation, we can tell a computer to do many thousands of repetitions. A long simulation (or hard mathematics) finds that the true probability is about 0.826. Most people think runs are somewhat unlikely, so even our short simulation challenges our intuition by showing that runs of three occur most of the time in 10 tosses.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p032" block_type="TXT">Once you have gained some experience in simulation, setting up the probability model (Step 1) is usually the hardest part of the process. Although coin tossing may not fascinate you, the model in <link href="example_19_1.html">Examples 1</link> is typical of many probability problems because it consists of <em>independent trials</em> (the tosses) all having the <em>same possible outcomes</em> with the <em>same probabilities</em>. Shooting 10 free throws and observing the sexes of 10 children have similar models and are simulated in much the same way. The new part of the model is independence, which simplifies our work because it allows us to simulate each of the 10 tosses in exactly the same way.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p054" block_type="TXT-ni">Before discussing more elaborate simulations, it is worth discussing the concept of independence further. We said earlier that independence can be verified only by observing many repetitions of random phenomena. It is probably more accurate to say that a <em>lack</em> of independence can be verified only by observing many repetitions of random phenomena. How does one recognize that two random phenomena are not independent? For example, how can we tell if tosses of a fair coin (that is, one for which the probability of a head is 0.5 and the probability of a tail is 0.5) are not independent?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p055" block_type="TXT">One approach might be to apply the definition of &#8220;independence.&#8221; For a sequence of tosses of a fair coin, one could compute the proportion of times in the sequence that a toss is followed by the same outcome&#8212;in other words, the frequency with which a head is followed by a head or a tail is followed by a tail. This proportion should be close to 0.5 if tosses are independent (knowing the outcome of one toss does not change the probabilities for outcomes of the next) and if many tosses have been observed.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p065" block_type="TXT-ni">Thus, our approach can help us recognize when independence is lacking, but not when independence is present.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p066" block_type="TXT">Another method for assessing independence is based on the concept of correlation, which we discussed in <link href="scc9e-ch14.xml">Chapter 14</link>. If two random phenomena have numerical outcomes, and we observe both phenomena in a sequence of <em>n</em> trials, we can compute the correlation for the resulting data. If the random phenomena are independent, there will be no straight-line relationship between them, and the correlation should be close to 0.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p067" block_type="TXT">It is not necessarily true that two random phenomena are independent if their correlation is 0. In <link href="exercise_14_24.html">Exercise 14.24</link> (page 334), there is a clear curved relationship between speed and mileage, but the correlation is 0. Independence implies no relationship at all, but correlation measures the strength of only a straight-line relationship.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch19-p068" block_type="TXT">Because independence implies no relationship, we would expect to see no overall pattern in a scatterplot of the data if the variables are independent. Looking at scatterplots is another method for determining if independence is lacking.</p>

A .300 hitter gets a hit in 30&#37; of times at bat. Could a .300 year just be luck? Typical major leaguers bat about 500 times a season and hit about .260. A hitter&#8217;s successive tries seem to be independent. From this model, we can calculate or simulate the probability of hitting .300. It is about 0.025.

<p id="scc9e-ch19-p070" block_type="TXT">Many methods for assessing independence exist. For example, if trials are not independent and, say, tossing a head increases the probability that the next toss is also a head, then in a sequence of tosses, we might expect to see unusually long runs of heads. We mentioned this idea of unusually long runs in <link href="example_17_5.html">Examples 5</link> (page 410) of <link href="scc9e-ch17.xml">Chapter 17</link>. Unusually long runs of made free throws would be expected if a basketball player has a &#8220;hot hand.&#8221; However, careful study has shown that runs of baskets made or missed are no more frequent in basketball than would be expected if each shot is independent of the player&#8217;s previous shots.</p>

What is more, doing a few simulations will increase your understanding of probability more than many pages of our prose. Having in mind these two goals of understanding simulation for itself and understanding simulation to understand probability, let us look at two more elaborate examples. The first still has independent trials, but there is no longer a fixed number of trials as there was when we tossed a coin 10 times.</p>

Use what you have learned in this chapter to describe how you would do a simulation to estimate the probability that, somewhere in a sequence of 1000 races, a string of 35 consecutive races would occur in which at least 30 times one of the three inside positions was assigned. Begin by describing how you would simulate one case of 1000 races and, for these races, how you would determine whether somewhere in the 1000 races there was a string of 35 consecutive races in which at least 30 times one of the three inside positions was assigned. Do not try to carry out the simulation. This would be very time-consuming and is best left to a computer. (In fact, the Ohio Racing Commission hired a statistician to compute the probability that in a sequence of 1000 races with varying numbers of horses, there would occur a string of 35 consecutive races in which one would receive one of the three inside positions at least 30 times.

Those in the sample were asked which U.S. president they regarded as the greatest. The poll showed that about 20&#37; of adult Americans regarded Ronald Reagan as the greatest U.S. president. Suppose that this is exactly true. Choosing an adult American at random then has probability 0.2 of getting one who would identify Ronald Reagan as the greatest president. If we interview adult Americans separately, we can assume that their responses are independent. We want to know the probability that a simple random sample of 100 adult Americans will contain at least 25 who say that Ronald Reagan is the greatest U.S. president. Explain carefully how to do this simulation and simulate <em>one</em> repetition of the poll using line 112 of <link href="table_a.html">Table A</link>.
