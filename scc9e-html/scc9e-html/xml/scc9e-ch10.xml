A writer organizes words into sentences and organizes the sentences into a story line. If the words are badly organized, the story isn&#8217;t clear. Data also need organizing if they are to tell a clear story. Too many words obscure a subject rather than illuminate it. Vast amounts of data are even harder to digest&#8212;we often need a brief summary to highlight essential facts. How to organize, summarize, and present data are our topics in the second part of this book.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch10-p-04" block_type="PO-TXT">Organizing and summarizing a large body of facts opens the door to distortions, both unintentional and deliberate. This is no less (but also no more) the case when the facts take the form of numbers rather than words. We will point out some of the traps that data presentations can set for the unwary. Those who picture statistics as primarily a piece of the liar&#8217;s art concentrate on the part of statistics that deals with summarizing and presenting data. We claim that misleading summaries and selective presentations go back to that after-the-apple conversation among Adam, Eve, and God. Don&#8217;t blame statistics. Do remember the saying &#8220;Figures won&#8217;t lie, but liars will figure,&#8221; and beware.</p>

In its March 2013 brief, &#8220;Death in the United States, 2011,&#8217;&#8217; <link href="figure_10_1.html">Figure 10.1</link> was included to display the top five causes of death for four age categories. A clear graphical display can make it easy for policy and decision makers to decide how to allocate resources for prevention or intervention. For instance, a quick glance at the pie chart for ages 1&#8211;24 shows that a large portion, 13&#37; of deaths in that age range, are attributed to suicide. A clear display of this staggering number makes a strong argument for allocation of resources.</p>

It is very clear on the bar graph that &#8220;Bachelor&#8217;s degree&#8217;&#8217; is the second largest category. This is not as clear on the pie chart. Bar graphs are better for making comparisons of the sizes of categories.

A pie chart usually displays the percentage for each category (rather than the count) and only works if you have all the categories (the percentages add to 100). A bar graph can display an entire distribution or can be used to display only a few categories. A bar graph can also compare the size of categories that are not parts of one whole.

<p id="scc9e-ch10-p-35" block_type="EXP-first">Governments generate tax revenue through various means. In its 2014 report, the Tax Foundation analyzed data for 2011 from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The United States&#8217; tax revenue comprises individual income tax (37.1&#37;), social insurance tax (22.8&#37;), consumption tax (18.3&#37;), property tax (12.4&#37;), and corporate income tax (9.4&#37;). A bar graph is appropriate to display these data because we have one value to explain the size of each tax category. Notice, a pie graph is appropriate as well, because these are all the parts of a whole. What if we wanted to compare the distribution of tax revenue for the United States to the average for all the other OECD countries? Pie charts are not good for comparisons. <link href="figure_10_5.html">Figure 10.5</link> is a bar graph for the distribution of government tax revenue for the United States with a second set of bars representing the average for all other OECD nations adjacent to the bars for the United States. This is called a side-by-side bar graph. A side-by-side bar graph is useful for making comparisons. It is now clear that the United States relies more heavily on individual income tax, while the other countries rely more heavily on consumption taxes.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch10-p-36" block_type="TXT-ni">Bar graphs compare several quantities by means of the differing heights of bars that represent the quantities. Our eyes, however, react to the <em>area</em> of the bars as well as to their height. When all bars have the same width, the area (width &#215; height) varies in proportion to the height and our eyes receive the right impression. When you draw a bar graph, make the bars equally wide. Artistically speaking, bar graphs are a bit dull. It is tempting to replace the bars with pictures for greater eye appeal.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch10-p-38" block_type="EXP-first"><link href="figure_10_6.html">Figure 10.6</link> is a <strong>pictogram</strong>. It is a bar graph in which pictures replace the bars. The graph is aimed at consumers shopping for a vacuum. It claims that a Dyson vacuum has more than twice the suction of any other vacuum. The numbers above the vacuums show the calculated air watts for three vacuums. We see the Dyson vacuum (far right) has roughly four times the air watts (160 is roughly 4 times 43) of the vacuum on the far left. However, this graphic makes it appear as though there is a much larger difference. Why is this?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch10-p-39" block_type="EXP-mid">To magnify a picture, the artist must increase <em>both</em> height and width to avoid distortion of the image. By increasing both the height and width of the Dyson vacuum, it appears to be 4 &#215; 4 = 16 times larger. Remember a bar graph should have bars of equal width&#8212;only the heights of the bars should vary. Replacing the bars on a bar graph with pictures is tempting, but it is difficult to keep the &#8220;bar&#8221; width equal without distorting the picture.</p>

Calculating the unemployment rate depends on the size of the workforce and the number of those in the workforce who are working. For example, the unemployment rate rises every year in January as holiday sales jobs end and outdoor work slows in the north due to winter weather. It would cause confusion (and perhaps political trouble) if the government&#8217;s official unemployment rate jumped every January. These are regular and predictable changes in unemployment. As such, the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes seasonal adjustments to the monthly unemployment rate before reporting it to the general public.</p></li>

We see that unemployment is always lower with more education&#8212;a strong argument for a college education! Also, the increase in unemployment was much more drastic during the Great Recession for the lower education levels. It appears that the unemployment rate is much more stable for those with higher education levels and much more variable for those with lower education levels.</p>

The artist couldn&#8217;t resist a nice background sketch and also cluttered the graph with grid lines. We find it harder than it should be to see the data. Using pictures of the female graduate at each time point distorts the values in the same way as a pictogram. Grid lines on a graph serve no purpose&#8212;if your audience must know the actual numbers, give them a table along with the graph. A good graph uses no more ink than is needed to present the data clearly. In statistical graphics, decoration is always a distraction from the data, and sometimes an actual distortion of the data.</p>

We studied this in <link href="scc9e-ch01.xml">Chapters 1</link> through <link href="scc9e-ch09.xml">9</link>. Once we have the data, and are satisfied that they were produced appropriately, we can begin to determine what the data tell us. Tables and graphs help us do this. In this chapter, we learned some basic methods for displaying data with tables and graphs. We learned what information these graphics provide. An important type of information is the distribution of the data&#8212;the values that occur and how often they occur. The concept of the distribution of data or the distribution of a variable is a fundamental way that statisticians think about data. We will encounter it again and again in future chapters.</p>
