Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine wanted to determine if some individuals develop a serious addiction called caffeine dependence syndrome. Eleven volunteers were recruited who were diagnosed as caffeine dependent. For a two-day period, these volunteers were given a capsule that either contained their daily amount of caffeine or a fake (nonactive) substance. Over another two-day period, at least one week after the first, the contents of the capsules received were switched. Whether the subjects first received the capsule containing caffeine or the capsule with the fake substance was determined by randomization. The subjects&#8217; diets were restricted during the study periods. All products with caffeine were prohibited, but to divert the subjects&#8217; attention from caffeine, products containing ingredients such as artificial sweeteners were also prohibited. Questionnaires assessing depression, mood, and the presence of certain physical symptoms were administered at the end of each two-day period. The subjects also completed a tapping task in which they were instructed to press a button 200 times as fast as they could. Finally, subjects were interviewed by a researcher, who did not know what was in the capsules the subjects had taken, to find other evidence of functional impairment. The Electronic Encyclopedia of Statistical Examples and Exercises (EESEE) story &#8220;Is Caffeine Dependence Real?&#8221; contains more information about this study. EESEE stories are available in LaunchPad.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-05" block_type="TXT-ni">Probability samples are a big idea, but sampling in practice has difficulties that just using random samples doesn&#8217;t solve. Randomized comparative experiments are also a big idea, but they don&#8217;t solve all the difficulties of experimenting. A sampler must know exactly what information she wants and must compose questions that extract that information from her sample. An experimenter must know exactly what treatments and responses he wants information about, and he must construct the apparatus needed to apply the treatments and measure the responses. This is what psychologists or medical researchers or engineers mean when they talk about &#8220;designing an experiment.&#8221; We are concerned with the <em>statistical</em> side of designing experiments, ideas that apply to experiments in psychology, medicine, engineering, and other areas as well. Even at this general level, you should understand the practical problems that can prevent an experiment from producing useful data.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-06" block_type="TXT">The logic of a randomized comparative experiment assumes that all the subjects are treated alike except for the treatments that the experiment is designed to compare. Any other unequal treatment can cause bias. Treating subjects exactly alike is hard to do.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-08" block_type="EXP-first">Rats and rabbits that are specially bred to be uniform in their inherited characteristics are the subjects in many experiments. However, animals, like people, can be quite sensitive to how they are treated. Here are two amusing examples of how unequal treatment can create bias.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-09" block_type="EXP-mid">Does a new breakfast cereal provide good nutrition? To find out, compare the weight gains of young rats fed the new product and rats fed a standard diet. The rats are randomly assigned to diets and are housed in large racks of cages. It turns out that rats in upper cages grow a bit faster than rats in bottom cages. If the experimenters put rats fed the new product at the top and those fed the standard diet below, the experiment is biased in favor of the new product. Solution: assign the rats to cages at random.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-10" block_type="EXP-mid">Another study looked at the effects of human affection on the cholesterol level of rabbits. All the rabbit subjects ate the same diet. Some (chosen at random) were regularly removed from their cages to have their furry heads scratched by friendly people. The rabbits who received affection had lower cholesterol. So affection for some but not other rabbits could bias an experiment in which the rabbits&#8217; cholesterol level is a response variable.</p>

Give them a placebo&#8212;one study found that 42&#37; of balding men maintained or increased the amount of hair on their heads when they took a placebo. Another study told 13 people who were very sensitive to poison ivy that the stuff being rubbed on one arm was poison ivy. It was a placebo, but all 13 broke out in a rash. The stuff rubbed on the other arm really was poison ivy, but the subjects were told it was harmless&#8212;and only 2 of the 13 developed a rash.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-14" block_type="EXP-mid">When the ailment is vague and psychological, like depression, some experts think that about three-quarters of the effect of the most widely used drugs is just the placebo effect. Others disagree (see <link href="exercise_6_31.html">Web Exercise 6.31</link>). The strength of the placebo effect in medical treatments is hard to pin down because it depends on the exact environment. How enthusiastic the doctor is seems to matter a lot. But &#8220;placebos work&#8221; is a good place to start when you think about planning medical experiments.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-15" block_type="TXT">The strength of the placebo effect is a strong argument for randomized comparative experiments. In the baldness study, 42&#37; of the placebo group kept or increased their hair, but 86&#37; of the men getting a new drug to fight baldness did so. The drug beats the placebo, so it has something besides the placebo effect going for it. Of course, the placebo effect is still part of the reason this and other treatments work.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-16" block_type="TXT">Because the placebo effect is so strong, it would be foolish to tell subjects in a medical experiment whether they are receiving a new drug or a placebo. Knowing that they are getting &#8220;just a placebo&#8221; might weaken the placebo effect and bias the experiment in favor of the other treatments. It is also foolish to tell doctors and other medical personnel what treatment each subject is receiving. If they know that a subject is getting &#8220;just a placebo,&#8221; they may expect less than if they know the subject is receiving a promising experimental drug. Doctors&#8217; expectations change how they interact with patients and even the way they diagnose a patient&#8217;s condition. Whenever possible, experiments with human subjects should be <em>double-blind</em>.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-22" block_type="EXP-first">Refusal to participate is a serious problem for medical experiments on treatments for major diseases such as cancer. As in the case of samples, bias can result if those who refuse are systematically different from those who cooperate.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-23" block_type="EXP-mid"><strong>Clinical trials</strong> are medical experiments involving human subjects. Minorities, women, the poor, and the elderly have long been underrepresented in clinical trials. In many cases, they weren&#8217;t asked. The law now requires representation of women and minorities, and data show that most clinical trials now have fair representation. But refusals remain a problem. Minorities, especially blacks, are more likely to refuse to participate. The government&#8217;s Office of Minority Health says, &#8220;Though recent studies have shown that African Americans have increasingly positive attitudes toward cancer medical research, several studies corroborate that they are still cynical about clinical trials. A major impediment for lack of participation is a lack of trust in the medical establishment.&#8221; Some remedies for lack of trust are complete and clear information about the experiment, insurance coverage for experimental treatments, participation of black researchers, and cooperation with doctors and health organizations in black communities.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-24" block_type="TXT">Subjects who participate but don&#8217;t follow the experimental treatment, called <strong>nonadherers</strong>, can also cause bias. AIDS patients who participate in trials of a new drug sometimes take other treatments on their own, for example. In addition, some AIDS subjects have their medication tested and drop out or add other medications if they were not assigned to the new drug. This may bias the trial against the new drug.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-25" block_type="TXT">Experiments that continue over an extended period of time also suffer <strong>dropouts</strong>, subjects who begin the experiment but do not complete it.

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-28" block_type="EXP-mid">The subjects were 1187 obese subjects. They were given a placebo for four weeks, and the subjects who wouldn&#8217;t take a pill regularly were dropped. This addressed the problem of nonadherers. There were 892 subjects left. These subjects were randomly assigned to Orlistat or a placebo, along with a weight-loss diet. After a year devoted to losing weight, 576 subjects were still participating. On the average, the Orlistat group lost 3.15 kilograms (about 7 pounds) more than the placebo group. The study continued for another year, now emphasizing maintaining the weight loss from the first year. At the end of the second year, 403 subjects were left. That&#8217;s only 45&#37; of the 892 who were randomized. Orlistat again beat the placebo, reducing the weight regained by an average of 2.25 kilograms (about 5 pounds).</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-29" block_type="EXP-mid">Can we trust the results when so many subjects dropped out? The overall dropout rates were similar in the two groups: 54&#37; of the subjects taking Orlistat and 57&#37; of those in the placebo group dropped out. Were dropouts related to the treatments? Placebo subjects in weight-loss experiments often drop out because they aren&#8217;t losing weight. This would bias the study against Orlistat because the subjects in the placebo group at the end may be those who could lose weight just by following a diet. The researchers looked carefully at the data available for subjects who dropped out. Dropouts from both groups had lost less weight than those who stayed, but careful statistical study suggested that there was little bias. Perhaps so, but the results aren&#8217;t as clean as our first look at experiments promised.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-34" block_type="EXP-mid">Playing a game in a laboratory for small stakes, knowing that the session will soon be over, is a long way from working for months developing a new product that never works right and is finally abandoned by your company.

Providing &#8220;equal treatment for all&#8221; except for the experimental and control therapies translates into &#8220;provide the best possible medical care for all.&#8221; The result: ordinary patients may not do as well as the clinical trial subjects when the new therapy comes into general use.

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-51" block_type="EXP-first">What are the effects of low-fat food labels on food consumption? Do people eat more of a snack food when the food is labeled as low fat? The answer may depend both on whether the snack food is labeled low fat and whether the label includes serving-size information. An experiment investigated this question using university staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students at a large university as subjects. Over 10 late-afternoon sessions, all subjects viewed episodes of a 60-minute, made-for-television program in a theater on campus and were asked to rate the episodes. They were also told that because it was late in the afternoon, they would be given a cold 24-ounce bottle of water and a bag of granola from a respected campus restaurant called The Spice Box. They were told to enjoy as much or as little of it as they wanted. Each participant received 640 calories (160 grams) of granola in ziplock bags that were labeled with an attractive 3.25- &#215;- 4-inch color label. Depending on the condition randomly assigned to the subjects, the bags were labeled either &#8220;Regular Rocky Mountain Granola&#8221; or &#8220;Low-Fat Rocky Mountain Granola.&#8221; Below this, the label indicated &#8220;Contains 1 Serving&#8221; or &#8220;Contains 2 Servings,&#8221; or it provided no serving-size information. As participants left the theater, they were asked how many serving sizes they believed their package contained. Out of sight of the participants, the researchers also weighed each granola bag.

Ground coffee is placed in a filter-lined dripper (a metal or ceramic basket with holes in the bottom that fits over a carafe). Hot water is poured over the coffee and allowed to drip into the carafe. A coffee shop carries three brands of dripper, each brand differing in shape and the placement of holes through which the coffee drips. Some experts believe that moistening the filter with hot water before filling with grounds affects flavor, so the coffee shop plans the following experiment. For each brand of dripper, coffee is to be brewed both with the filter moistened and with the filter dry. A trained barista will brew two cups of coffee for each of the six combinations of dripper and wet/dry filter. A panel of trained tasters scores each cup for flavor on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating better flavor.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-56" block_type="TXT">Experimenters often want to study the combined effects of several variables simultaneously. The interaction of several factors can produce effects that could not be predicted from looking at the effect of each factor alone. Perhaps longer commercials increase interest in a product, and more commercials also increase interest, but if we both make a commercial longer and show it more often, viewers get annoyed and their interest in the product drops. An experiment similar to that in <link href="example_6_8.html">Example 8</link> will help us find out.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-57" block_type="TXT-ni">Completely randomized designs are the simplest statistical designs for experiments. They illustrate clearly the principles of control and randomization. However, completely randomized designs are often inferior to more elaborate statistical designs. In particular, matching the subjects in various ways can produce more precise results than simple randomization.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-58" block_type="TXT">One common design that combines matching with randomization is the <strong>matched pairs design</strong>. A matched pairs design compares just two treatments. Choose pairs of subjects that are as closely matched as possible. Assign one of the treatments to each subject in a pair by tossing a coin or reading odd and even digits from <link href="table_a.html">Table A</link>. Sometimes, each &#8220;pair&#8221; in a matched pairs design consists of just one subject, who gets both treatments together (for example, each on a different arm or leg) or one after the other. Each subject serves as his or her own control. The <em>order</em> of the treatments can influence the subject&#8217;s response, so we randomize the order for each subject, again by a coin toss.</p>

The active ingredient in the other is oil of lemon eucalyptus. Repellants are tested on several volunteers. For each volunteer, the left arm is sprayed with one of the repellants and the right arm with the other. This is a matched pairs design in which each subject compares two insect repellants. To guard against the possibility that responses may depend on which arm is sprayed, which arm receives which repellant is determined randomly. Beginning 30 minutes after applying the repellants, once every hour, volunteers put each arm in separate 8-cubic-foot cages containing 200 disease-free female mosquitoes in need of a blood meal to lay their eggs. Volunteers leave their arms in the cages for five minutes. The repellant is considered to have failed if a volunteer is bitten two or more times in a five-minute session. The response is the number of one-hour sessions until a repellant fails.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-61" block_type="TXT">Matched pairs designs use the principles of comparison of treatments and randomization. However, the randomization is not complete&#8212;we do not randomly assign all the subjects at once to the two treatments. Instead, we randomize only within each matched pair. This allows matching to reduce the effect of variation among the subjects. Matched pairs are an example of <em>block designs</em>.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-66" block_type="MN-TXT">The effect was first described in the 1950s by researcher Henry A. Landsberger during his analysis of experiments conducted during the 1920s and 1930s at the Hawthorne works electric company.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-67" block_type="MN-TXT">The electric company had commissioned research to determine if there was a relationship between productivity and work environment.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-68" block_type="MN-TXT">The focus of the original studies was to determine if increasing or decreasing the amount of light workers received would have an effect on worker productivity. Employee productivity seemed to increase due to the changes but then decreased after the experiment was over. Researchers suggested that productivity increased due to attention from the research team and not because of changes to the experimental variables. Lansdberger defined the Hawthorne effect as a short-term improvement in performance caused by observing workers.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch06-p-69" block_type="MN-TXT">Later research into the Hawthorne effect has suggested that the original results may have been overstated. In 2009, researchers at the University of Chicago reanalyzed the original data and found that other factors also played a role in productivity and that the effect originally described was weak at best.</p>

We use two different names only because the idea developed separately for sampling and experiments. The advantages of block designs are the same as the advantages of stratified samples.

Blocking also allows more precise overall conclusions because the systematic differences between men and women can be removed when we study the overall effects of the three commercials. The idea of blocking is an important additional principle of statistical design of experiments. A wise experimenter will form blocks based on the most important unavoidable sources of variability among the experimental subjects. Randomization will then average out the effects of the remaining variation and allow an unbiased comparison of the treatments.</p>

What concerns might you have about whether your experimental results will reduce accidents with cars if all bicyclists are required to use such lights? (<em>Hint</em>: To help you answer this question, consider the following example. A 1980 report by the Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that adding a center brake light to cars reduced rear-end collisions by as much as 50&#37;. These findings were the result of a randomized comparative experiment. As a result, center brake lights have been required on all cars sold since 1986. Ten years later, the Insurance Institute found only a 5&#37; reduction in rear-end collisions. Apparently, when the study was originally carried out, center brake lights were unusual and caught the eye of following drivers. By 1996, center brake lights were common and no longer captured attention.)</p></li>

In the study, for 18 weeks, researchers fed a group of mice a high-fat diet on a fixed schedule (eating at the same time and for the same length of time every day). They compared these mice to three control groups: one that ate a low-fat diet on a fixed schedule, one that ate an unscheduled low-fat diet (in the quantity and frequency of its choosing), and one that ate an unscheduled high-fat diet. All four groups of mice gained weight throughout the experiment. However, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet had a lower final body weight than the mice eating an unscheduled high-fat diet. Surprisingly, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet also had a lower final body weight than the mice that ate an unscheduled low-fat diet, even though both groups consumed the same amount of calories. In addition, the mice on the scheduled high-fat diet exhibited a unique metabolic state in which the fats they ingested were not stored, but rather utilized for energy at times when no food was available, such as between meals. Briefly discuss the questions that arise in using this experiment to decide the benefits of a scheduled high-fat diet for humans.</p>

Because ibuprofen is known to possess a wide range of anti-inflammatory actions, it was hypothesized that it might help in the prevention of atherosclerotic lesion development. Both a low-cholesterol and a high-cholesterol diet were used, as the extent of atherosclerosis is also affected by diet. Thirty-two New Zealand rabbits served as subjects in the experiment and, after three months, the percentage of the surface covered by atherosclerotic plaques in a region of the aorta was evaluated. Although ibuprofen did suppress the expression of a gene thought to be related to atherosclerosis, it was not shown to have an effect on the extent of fat-induced atherosclerotic lesions.</p>

Participants read statements such as, &#8220;This product is healthy,&#8221; &#8220;This product is wholesome,&#8221; This product is natural,&#8221; and &#8220;This product is organic.&#8221; They then rated how much they agreed with the statements on a seven-point scale with &#8220;1&#8221; indicating strong agreement and &#8220;7&#8221; indicating strong disagreement. Each subject&#8217;s responses were combined to create a perceived healthiness score. The researchers have 100 students available to serve as subjects.</p>

Response variables include students&#8217; final-exam scores and a measure of their attitude toward statistics. One study compared two levels of technology for large lectures: standard (overhead projectors and chalk) and multimedia. The individuals in the study were the eight lectures in a basic statistics course. There were four instructors, each of whom taught two lectures. Because lecturers differed, a block design was used with their lectures forming four blocks. Suppose the lectures and lecturers were as follows.</p>
