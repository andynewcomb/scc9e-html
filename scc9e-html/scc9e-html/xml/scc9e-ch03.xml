<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-04" block_type="BX4-TXT-first"><phrase block_type="BX4-H-ri">CASE STUDY</phrase> According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 173 cases of measles reported between June 1 and May 29, 2015. About 87&#37; of the cases were related to five outbreaks during the same time period. The CDC also reported that the &#8220;United States experienced a record number of measles cases during 2014, with 668 cases from 27 states reported to CDC&#8217;s National <termref term="Center">Center</termref> for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000.&#8221; According to the same report by the CDC, &#8220;the majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated.&#8220; Vaccinating children against diseases like measles is controversial.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-05" block_type="BX4-TXT-i">The debate about childhood vaccinations became a major news issue in late 2014 and early 2015. As of June 2015, Mississippi and West Virginia are the only two states that require vaccines for children with only medical exemptions. California may become the third state. Other states allow exemptions for personal and religious beliefs. A Gallup Poll conducted from February 28&#8211;March 1, 2015, asked the following question: &#8220;How important is it that parents get their children vaccinated&#8212;extremely important, very important, somewhat important, or not at all important?&#8221; The Gallup Poll found that 54&#37; of respondents said &#8220;extremely important&#8221; (down from 64&#37; who responded to a similar 2001 Gallup Poll). Can we trust this conclusion?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-06" block_type="BX4-TXT-i">Reading further, we find that Gallup talked with 1015 randomly selected adults to reach these conclusions. We&#8217;re happy Gallup chooses at <termref term="random">random</termref>&#8212;we wouldn&#8217;t get unbiased information about the importance of childhood vaccinations by asking people attending a conference of the American Medical Association. However, the U.S. <termref term="Census">Census</termref> Bureau said that there were about 258 million adults in the United States in 2013. How can 1015 people, even a random <termref term="sample">sample</termref> of 1015 people, tell us about the opinions of 258 million people? Is 54&#37; who feel that it is extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated evidence that, in fact, the majority of Americans feel this way? By the end of this chapter, you will learn the answers to these questions.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-08" block_type="TXT-ni">Gallup&#8217;s 2015 finding that &#8220;a slight majority of Americans, 54&#37;, say it is extremely important that parents get their children vaccinated&#8221; makes a claim about the <termref term="population">population</termref> of 258 million adults. But Gallup doesn&#8217;t know the truth about the entire population. The poll contacted 1015 people and found that 54&#37; of them said it is extremely important for parents to vaccinate their children. Because the <termref term="sample">sample</termref> of 1015 people was chosen at <termref term="random">random</termref>, it&#8217;s reasonable to think that they represent the entire population pretty well. So Gallup turns the <em>fact</em> that 54&#37; of the <em>sample</em> feel childhood vaccinations are extremely important into an <em>estimate</em> that about 54&#37; of <em>all American adults</em> feel childhood vaccinations are extremely important. That&#8217;s a basic move in statistics: use a fact about a sample to estimate the truth about the whole population. To think about such moves, we must be clear whether a number describes a sample or a population. Here is the vocabulary we use.</p>

Random samples eliminate <em><termref term="bias">bias</termref></em> from the act of choosing a sample, but they can still be wrong because of the <termref term="variability">variability</termref> that results when we choose at random.

That is, the truth about the population is that <em>p</em> = 0.5.

<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-58" block_type="EXP-ni">Gallup announced a margin of error of 4&#37;, and our quick method gave us 3.1&#37;. Our quick and approximate method can disagree a bit with Gallup&#8217;s for two reasons. First, polls usually round their announced margin of error to the nearest whole percent to keep their press releases simple. Second, our rough formula works for an SRS. We will see in the next chapter that most national samples are more complicated than an SRS in ways that tend to slightly increase the margin of error. In fact, Gallup&#8217;s survey methods section for this particular poll included the statement, &#8220;Each sample of national adults includes a <termref term="minimum">minimum</termref> quota of 50&#37; cellphone respondents and 50&#37; landline respondents, with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region. Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random-digit-dial methods.&#8221; While these methods go beyond what we will study in the next chapter, the complexity of collecting a national sample increases the value of the margin of error.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-60" block_type="TXT">Our quick and approximate method also reveals an important fact about how margins of error behave. Because the sample size <em>n</em> appears in the denominator of the fraction, larger samples have smaller margins of error. We knew that. Because the formula uses the square root of the sample size, however, <em>to cut the margin of error in half, we must use a sample four times as large</em>.</p>

Imagine sampling soup by taking a spoonful from a pot. The spoon doesn&#8217;t know whether it is surrounded by a small pot or a large pot. As long as the pot of soup is well mixed (so that the spoon selects a &#8220;random sample&#8221; of the soup) and the spoonful is a small fraction of the total, the variability of the result depends only on the size of the spoon.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch03-p-90" block_type="TXT">This is good news for national sample surveys like the Gallup Poll. A random sample of size 1000 or 2500 has small variability because the sample size is large.

Statisticians don&#8217;t love them because elections often don&#8217;t go as forecasted, even when the polls use all the right statistical methods. Many people who respond to the polls change their minds before the election. Others say they are undecided. Still others say which candidate they favor but won&#8217;t bother to vote when the election arrives. Election forecasting is one of the less satisfactory uses of sample surveys because we must ask people now how they will vote in the future.</p>

Make a confidence statement about the percentage of all adults who thought abortion should be illegal in all circumstances, at the time the poll was taken. (Assume that this is an SRS, and use the quick and approximate method to find the margin of error.)</p>

In both polls, national opinion was divided, suggesting that there is considerable moral uncertainty regarding both issues. What was the margin of error (the &#8220;statistical uncertainty&#8221;) in both polls? Is it possible for issues with a high degree of moral uncertainty to have very little statistical uncertainty? Discuss.</p>

The monthly unemployment <termref term="rate">rate</termref>, for example, is based on the Current Population Survey of about 60,000 households. The margin of error in the unemployment rate is announced as about two-tenths of 1 percentage point with 90&#37; confidence. Would the margin of error for 95&#37; confidence be smaller or larger?

Of those surveyed, 70&#37; attributed a company&#8217;s failure or success to the decisions of its top executives. The poll asked the same question of a random sample of 110 business executives.

Suppose that you are drawing simple random samples of size 25 from a large number of college students and that 20&#37; of the students are unemployed during the summer. To simulate this SRS, generate 25 random digits using the <em>Simple Random Sample</em> applet or let 25 consecutive digits in <link href="table_a.html">Table A</link> stand for the 25 students in your sample. The digits 0 and 1 stand for unemployed students, and other digits stand for employed students. This is an accurate imitation of the SRS because 0 and 1 make up 20&#37; of the 10 equally likely digits.</p>

Make a histogram like that in <link href="figure_3_1.html">Figure 3.1</link> to display the results of your 50 samples. Is the truth about the population (20&#37; unemployed, or 5 in a sample of 25) near the center of your graph?
