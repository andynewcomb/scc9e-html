<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-04" block_type="BX4-TXT-FIRST"><phrase block_type="BX4-H-ri">CASE STUDY</phrase> Are people with larger brains more intelligent? People have investigated this question throughout history. To answer it, we must <strong>measure</strong> &#8220;intelligence.&#8221; This requires us to reduce the vague idea to a number that can go up or down. The first step is to say what we mean by intelligence. Does a vast knowledge of many subjects constitute intelligence? How about the ability to solve difficult puzzles or do complicated mathematical calculations? Or is it some combination of all of these?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Once we decide what intelligence is, we must actually produce the numbers. Should we use the score on a written test? Perhaps a formula that also includes grades in school would be better. Not only is it hard to say exactly what &#8220;intelligence&#8221; is, but it&#8217;s hard to attach a number to measure whatever we say it is. And in the end, can we even trust the number we produce?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-27" block_type="TXT-ni">Measurement is the process of turning concepts like length or employment status into precisely defined variables. Using a tape measure to turn the idea of &#8220;length&#8221; into a number is straightforward because we know exactly what we mean by length. Measuring college readiness is controversial because it isn&#8217;t clear exactly what makes a student ready for college work. Using SAT scores at least says exactly how we will get numbers. Measuring leisure time requires that we first say what time counts as leisure. Even counting highway deaths requires us to say exactly what counts as a highway death: Pedestrians hit by cars? People in cars hit by a train at a crossing? People who die from injuries six months after an accident? We can simply accept the government&#8217;s counts, but someone had to answer those and other questions in order to know what to count. For example, to be included the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, &#8220;a crash must involve a motor vehicle traveling on a trafficway customarily open to the public and must result in the death of at least one person (occupant of a vehicle or a non-motorist) within 30 days of the crash.&#8221; The details of when a death is counted as a highway death are necessary because they can make a difference in the data.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-30" block_type="EXP-first">Each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) announces the <em>unemployment rate</em> for the previous month. People who are not available for work (retired people, for example, or students who do not want to work while in school) should not be counted as unemployed just because they don&#8217;t have a job. To be unemployed, a person must first be in the labor force. That is, the person must be available for work and looking for work. The unemployment rate is</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-31" block_type="EXP-first"><phrase data-math="math_1"></phrase></p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-32" block_type="EXP-mid">To complete the exact definition of the unemployment rate, the BLS has very detailed descriptions of what it means to be &#8220;in the labor force&#8221; and what it means to be &#8220;employed.&#8221; For example, if you are on strike but expect to return to the same job, you count as employed. If you are not working and did not look for work in the last two weeks, you are not in the labor force. So, people who say they want to work but are too discouraged to keep looking for a job don&#8217;t count as unemployed. The details matter. The official unemployment rate would be different if the government were to use a different definition of unemployment.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-33" block_type="TXT">The BLS estimates the unemployment rate based on interviews with the sample in the monthly Current Population Survey. The interviewer can&#8217;t simply ask, &#8220;Are you in the labor force?&#8221; and &#8220;Are you employed?&#8221; Many questions are needed to classify a person as employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. Changing the questions can change the unemployment rate. At the beginning of 1994, after several years of planning, the BLS introduced computer-assisted interviewing and improved its questions. <link href="figure_8_1.html">Figure 8.1</link> is a graph of the unemployment rate that appeared on the front page of the BLS monthly news release on the employment situation. There is a gap in the graph before January 1994 because of the change in the interviewing process. The unemployment rate would have been 6.3&#37; under the old system. It was 6.7&#37; under the new system. That&#8217;s a big enough difference to make politicians unhappy.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-71" block_type="BX3-TXT-ni">Colleges use a variety of measures to make admissions decisions. The student&#8217;s record in high school is the most important, but SAT scores do matter, especially at selective colleges. The SAT has the advantage of being a national test. An A in algebra means different things in different high schools, but an SAT Math score of 625 means the same thing everywhere. The SAT can&#8217;t measure willingness to work hard or creativity, so it won&#8217;t predict college performance exactly, but most colleges have long found it helpful.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-72" block_type="BX3-TXT">The accompanying table gives some results about how well SAT scores predict first-year college grades from a sample of 151,316 students in 2006. The numbers in the table say what percentage of the variation among students in college grades can be predicted by SAT scores (Critical Reading, Writing, and Math tests combined), by high school grades, and by SAT and high school grades together. An entry of 0&#37; would mean no predictive validity, and 100&#37; would mean predictions were always exactly correct.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-73" block_type="BX3-TXT">How well do you think SAT scores predict first-year college grades? Should SAT scores be used in deciding college admissions?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-74" block_type="TXT-ni">Using a bathroom scale to measure your weight is valid. If your scale is like many commonly used ones, however, the measurement may not be very accurate. It measures weight, but it may not give the true weight. Let&#8217;s say that originally your scale always read 3 pounds too high, so</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-75" block_type="EQ">measured weight = true weight &#43; 3 pounds</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_172" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">172</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-77" block_type="TXT">If that is the whole story, the scale will always give the same reading for the same true weight. Most scales vary a bit&#8212;they don&#8217;t always give the same reading when you step off and step right back on. Your scale now is somewhat old and rusty. It still always reads 3 pounds too high because its aim is off, but now it is also erratic, so readings deviate from 3 pounds. This morning it sticks a bit and reads 1 pound too low for that reason. So the reading is</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-78" block_type="EQ">measured weight = true weight &#43; 3 pounds &#8722; 1 pound</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-79" block_type="TXT-ni">When you step off and step right back on, the scale sticks in a different spot that makes it read 1 pound too high. The reading you get is now</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-80" block_type="EQ">measured weight = true weight &#43; 3 pounds &#43; 1 pound</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-81" block_type="TXT-ni">You don&#8217;t like the fact that this second reading is higher than the first, so you again step off and step right back on. The scale again sticks in a different spot and you get the reading</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-82" block_type="EQ">measured weight = true weight &#43; 3 pounds &#8722; 1.5 pounds</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-83" block_type="TXT-ni">If you have nothing better to do than keep stepping on and off the scale, you will keep getting different readings. They center on a reading 3 pounds too high, but they vary about that center.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-84" block_type="TXT">Your scale has two kinds of errors. If it didn&#8217;t stick, the scale would always read 3 pounds high. That is true every time anyone steps on the scale. This systematic error that occurs every time we make a measurement is called <em>bias</em>. Your scale also sticks&#8212;but how much this changes the reading differs every time someone steps on the scale. Sometimes stickiness pushes the scale reading up; sometimes it pulls it down. The result is that the scale weighs 3 pounds too high on the average, but its reading varies when we weigh the same thing repeatedly. We can&#8217;t predict the error due to stickiness, so we call it <em>random error</em>.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-112" block_type="TXT">Reliability says only that the result is dependable. Bias means that in repeated measurements the <em>tendency</em> is to systematically either overstate or understate the true value. It does not necessarily mean that every measurement overstates or understates the true value. Bias and lack of reliability are different kinds of error. And don&#8217;t confuse reliability with validity just because both sound like good qualities. Using a scale to measure weight is valid even if the scale is not reliable.</p>

Paul Broca, a professor of surgery, showed that filling a skull with small lead shot, then pouring out the shot and weighing it, gave quite reliable measurements of the skull&#8217;s volume. These accurate measurements do not, however, give a valid measure of intelligence. Skull volume turned out to have no relation to intelligence or achievement.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-119" block_type="TXT-ni">What time is it? Much modern technology, such as the Global Positioning System, which uses satellite signals to tell you where you are, requires very exact measurements of time. In 1967, the International Committee for Weights and Measures defined the second to be the time required for 9,192,631,770 vibrations of a cesium atom. The cesium atom is not affected by changes in temperature, humidity, and air pressure, like physical clocks are. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has the world&#8217;s most accurate atomic clock and broadcasts the results (with some loss in transmission) by radio, telephone, and Internet.</p>

NIST&#8217;s measurements are very reliable, but the preceding numbers do show some variation. There is no such thing as a perfectly reliable measurement.

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-133" block_type="TXT-ni">Statisticians think about measurement much the same way as they think about sampling. In both settings, the big idea is to ask, &#8220;What would happen if we did this many times?&#8221; In sampling, we want to estimate a population parameter, and we worry that our estimate may be biased or vary too much from sample to sample. Now we want to measure the true value of some property, and we worry that our measurement may be biased or vary too much when we repeat the measurement on the same individual. Bias is systematic error that happens every time; high variability (low reliability) means that our result can&#8217;t be trusted because it isn&#8217;t repeatable.</p>

You know that there are really good scales around: start at the doctor&#8217;s office, go to the physics lab, end up at NIST. You can measure your weight as accurately as you wish. This makes it easy to see that your bathroom scale always reads 3 pounds too high. Reliability is also easy to describe&#8212;step on and off the scale many times and see how much its readings vary.</p>

If you take the F-scale test many times, you remember what answers you gave the first time. That is, repeats of the same psychological measurement are not really repeats.

<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-148" block_type="TXT-ni">The point is not that psychologists lack answers to these questions. The first two are controversial because not all psychologists think about human personality in the same way. The second two questions have at least partial answers but not simple answers. The point is that &#8220;measurement,&#8221; which seems so straightforward when we measure weight, is complicated indeed when we try to measure human personality.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch08-p-149" block_type="TXT">There is a larger lesson here. Be wary of statistical &#8220;facts&#8221; about squishy topics like authoritarian personality, intelligence, and even readiness for college. The numbers look solid, as numbers always do. But data are a human product and reflect human desires, prejudices, and weaknesses. If we don&#8217;t understand and agree on what we are measuring, the numbers may produce more disagreement than enlightenment.</p>

In statistics, data are ultimately represented by numbers. The planning of the production of data through a sample or experiment does not by itself produce these numbers. The extent to which these numbers represent the characteristics we wish to study affects the quality and relevance of our conclusions. When you work with data or read about a statistical study, ask exactly how the variables are defined and whether they leave out some things you want to know. This chapter presents several ideas to think about in assessing the variables measured and hence the conclusions based on these measurements.</p>
