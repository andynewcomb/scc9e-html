Researchers at the University of Bristol in England attempted to answer this question. Forty-two male and 42 female students at the University of Bristol were recruited to take part in a study. Students were randomly assigned to receive either a strong alcoholic drink (vodka, tonic water, and lime cordial) or a placebo (tonic water and lime cordial). They were given 15 minutes to consume their drink, after which they were asked to rate the facial attractiveness of 20 male and female faces. The researchers compared the ratings of those receiving the alcoholic drink with those receiving the placebo. </p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Many students would like to be participants in such an experiment. But is having subjects consume a strong alcoholic drink so that their judgment is impaired ethical? By the end of this chapter, you will have learned the principles that will help you answer this question. </p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-06" block_type="TXT-ni">The production and use of data, like all human endeavors, raise ethical questions. We won&#8217;t discuss the telemarketer who begins a telephone sales pitch with &#8220;I&#8217;m conducting a survey,&#8221; when the goal is to sell you something rather than collect useful information. Such deception is clearly unethical. It enrages legitimate survey organizations, which find the public less willing to talk with them. Neither will we discuss those few researchers who, in the pursuit of professional advancement, publish fake data. There is no ethical question here&#8212;faking data to advance your career is just wrong. It will end your career when uncovered. But just how honest must researchers be about real, unfaked data? Here is an example that suggests the answer is &#8220;More honest than they often are.&#8221;</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-09" block_type="EXP-first">Papers reporting scientific research are supposed to be short, with no extra baggage. Brevity can allow the researchers to avoid complete honesty about their data. Did they choose their subjects in a biased way? Did they report data on only some of their subjects? Did they try several statistical analyses and report only the ones that supported what the researchers hoped to find? The statistician John Bailar screened more than 4000 medical papers in more than a decade as consultant to the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. He says, &#8220;When it came to the statistical review, it was often clear that critical information was lacking, and the gaps nearly always had the practical effect of making the authors&#8217; conclusions look stronger than they should have.&#8221; The situation is no doubt worse in fields that screen published work less carefully. </p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-10" block_type="TXT">The most complex issues of data ethics arise when we collect data from people (but research with animals also raises ethical issues&#8212;see <link href="exercise_7_43.html">Exercise 7.43</link>). The ethical difficulties are more severe for experiments that impose some treatment on people than for sample surveys that simply gather information. Trials of new medical treatments, for example, can do harm as well as good to their subjects. Here are some basic standards of data ethics that must be obeyed by any study that gathers data from human subjects, whether sample survey or experiment.</p>
<box id="scc9e-ch07-box-03" numbered="false" block_type="BX1">
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-11" block_type="BX1-T">Basic data ethics</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-12" block_type="BX1-TXT-ni">The organization that carries out the study must have an <strong>institutional review board</strong> that reviews all planned studies in advance in order to protect the subjects from possible harm.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-13" block_type="BX1-TXT-i">All individuals who are subjects in a study must give their <strong>informed consent</strong> before data are collected.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-14" block_type="BX1-TXT-i">All individual data must be kept <strong>confidential</strong>. Only statistical summaries for groups of subjects may be made public.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-15" block_type="TXT">If subjects are children, then their consent is needed in addition to that of the parents or guardians.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-16" block_type="TXT">Many journals have a formal requirement of explicitly addressing human subjects issues if the study is classified as human subjects research. For example, here is a statement from the instructions for authors for <em>JAMA</em> (<em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em>): </p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-17" block_type="EXT-TXT"><em>For all manuscripts reporting data from studies involving human participants or animals, formal review and approval, or formal review and waiver, by an appropriate institutional review board or ethics committee is required and should be described in the Methods section. </em></p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-19" block_type="TXT-ni">For situations where a formal ethics review committee does not exist, the<em> Journal of the American Medical Association</em> instructs investigators to follow the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. When human subjects are involved, investigators are to state in the Methods section the manner in which informed consent was obtained from the study participants (that is, oral or written). Also, the law requires that studies funded by the federal government obey these principles. But neither the law nor the consensus of experts is completely clear about the details of their application.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-20" block_type="TXT-ni">The purpose of an institutional review board (often abbreviated IRB) is not to decide whether a proposed study will produce valuable information or whether it is statistically sound. The board&#8217;s purpose is, in the words of one university&#8217;s board, &#8220;to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects (including patients) recruited to participate in research activities.&#8221; The board reviews the plan of the study and can require changes. It reviews the consent form to ensure that subjects are informed about the nature of the study and about any potential risks. Once research begins, the board monitors its progress at least once a year.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-21" block_type="TXT">The most pressing issue concerning institutional review boards is whether their workload has become so large that their effectiveness in protecting subjects drops. When the government temporarily stopped human-subject research at Duke University Medical Center in 1999 due to inadequate protection of subjects, more than 2000 studies at Duke were in progress. That&#8217;s a lot of review work. There are shorter review procedures for projects that involve only minimal risks to subjects, such as most sample surveys. When a board is overloaded, there is a temptation to put more proposals in the minimal-risk category to speed the work.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-25" block_type="TXT-ni">Both words in the phrase &#8220;informed consent&#8221; are important, and both can be controversial. Subjects must be <em>informed</em> in advance about the nature of a study and any risk of harm it may bring. In the case of a sample survey, physical harm is not possible. The subjects should be told what kinds of questions the survey will ask and about how much of their time it will take. Experimenters must tell subjects the nature and purpose of the study and outline possible risks. Subjects must then <em>consent,</em> usually in writing.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-27" block_type="EXP-first">Are there some subjects who can&#8217;t give informed consent? It was once common, for example, to test new vaccines on prison inmates who gave their consent in return for good-behavior credit. Now we worry that prisoners are not really free to refuse, and the law forbids medical experiments in prisons.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-28" block_type="EXP-mid">Children can&#8217;t give fully informed consent, so the usual procedure is to ask their parents. A study of new ways to teach reading is about to start at a local elementary school, so the study team sends consent forms home to parents. Many parents don&#8217;t return the forms. Can their children take part in the study because the parents did not say No, or should we allow only children whose parents returned the form and said Yes?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-29" block_type="EXP-mid">What about research into new medical treatments for people with mental disorders? What about studies of new ways to help emergency room patients who may be unconscious or have suffered a stroke? In most cases, there is no time even to get the consent of the family.

We trust the monthly unemployment rate, for example, to guide both public and private decisions. Honesty can&#8217;t be taken for granted, however. In 1998, the Russian government arrested the top statisticians in the State Committee for Statistics. They were accused of taking bribes to fudge data to help companies avoid taxes. &#8220;It means that we know nothing about the performance of Russian companies,&#8221; said one newspaper editor.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-35" block_type="TXT">The difficulties of informed consent do not vanish even for capable subjects. Some researchers, especially in medical trials, regard consent as a barrier to getting patients to participate in research. They may not explain all possible risks; they may not point out that there are other therapies that might be better than those being studied; they may be too optimistic when talking with patients even when the consent form has all the right details. On the other hand, mentioning every possible risk leads to very long consent forms that really are barriers. &#8220;They are like rental car contracts,&#8221; one lawyer said. Some subjects don&#8217;t read forms that run five or six printed pages. Others are frightened by the large number of possible (but unlikely) disasters that might happen and so refuse to participate. Of course, unlikely disasters sometimes happen. When they do, lawsuits follow, and the consent forms become yet longer and more detailed.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-36" block_type="TXT-ni">Ethical problems do not disappear once a study has been cleared by the review board, has obtained consent from its subjects, and has actually collected data about the subjects. It is important to protect the subjects&#8217; privacy by keeping all data about individuals confidential. The report of an opinion poll may say what percentage of the 1500 respondents felt that legal immigration should be reduced. It may not report what <em>you</em> said about this or any other issue.</p>

  <p id="scc9e-ch07-p-37" block_type="TXT">Confidentiality is not the same as <strong>anonymity</strong>. Anonymity means that subjects are anonymous&#8212;their names are not known even to the director of the study. It is not possible to determine which subject produced which data. Anonymity is rare in statistical studies. Even where anonymity is possible (mainly in surveys conducted by mail), it prevents any follow-up to improve nonresponse or inform subjects of results.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-38" block_type="TXT">Any breach of confidentiality is a serious violation of data ethics. The best practice is to separate the identity of the subjects from the rest of the data at once. Sample surveys, for example, use the identification only to check on who did or did not respond. In an era of advanced technology, however, it is no longer enough to be sure that each individual set of data protects people&#8217;s privacy. The U.S. government, for example, maintains a vast amount of information about citizens in many separate databases&#8212;census responses, tax returns, Social Security information, data from surveys such as the Current Population Survey, and so on. Many of these databases can be searched by computers for statistical studies. A clever computer search of several databases might be able, by combining information, to identify you and learn a great deal about you, even if your name and other identification have been removed from the data available for search. A colleague from Germany once remarked that &#8220;female full professor of statistics with a PhD from the United States&#8221; was enough to identify her among all the 83 million residents of Germany. Privacy and confidentiality of data are hot issues among statisticians in the computer age. Computer hacking and thefts of laptops containing data add to the difficulties. Is it even possible to guarantee confidentiality of data stored in databases that can be hacked or stolen? <link href="figure_7_1.html">Figure 7.1</link> displays the Internet privacy policy that appears on the Social Security website.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-41" block_type="EXP-ni">Citizens are required to give information to the government. Think of tax returns and Social Security contributions, for example, in the United States. The government needs these data for administrative purposes&#8212;to see if we paid the right amount of tax and how large a Social Security benefit we are owed when we retire. Some people feel that individuals should be able to forbid any other use of their data, even with all identification removed. This would prevent using government records to study, say, the ages, incomes, and household sizes of Social Security recipients. Such a study could well be vital to debates on reforming Social Security.</p>

Who owns the data? The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that &#8220;data&#8221; are facts and cannot be copyrighted. However, compilations of facts are generally copyrightable. So the answer to who owns data is not always clear. No permission is required for the use of published data or the creative use of a subset of data. Data from a table used to make a graphical presentation or data read off a graph can be used freely without permission. But beyond these guidelines, there is tremendous variation in determining whether permission is needed.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-53" block_type="EXP-ni">In the 1930s, syphilis was common among black men in the rural South of the United States, a group that had almost no access to medical care. The Public Health Service recruited 399 poor black sharecroppers with syphilis and 201 others without the disease in order to observe how syphilis progressed when no treatment was given. Beginning in 1943, penicillin became available to treat syphilis. However, the study subjects were not treated, even after penicillin became a standard treatment for syphilis. In fact, the Public Health Service tried to prevent any treatment until word leaked out and forced an end to the study in 1972.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-54" block_type="EXP-mid">The Tuskegee study is an extreme example of investigators following their own interests and ignoring the well-being of their subjects.

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-56" block_type="TXT">Because &#8220;the interests of the subject must always prevail,&#8221; medical treatments can be tested in clinical trials only when there is reason to hope that they will help the patients who are subjects in the trials. Future benefits alone aren&#8217;t enough to justify any experiment with human subjects. Of course, if there is already strong evidence that a treatment works and is safe, it is unethical <em>not</em> to give it. Dr. Charles Hennekens of Harvard Medical School, who directed the large clinical trial that showed that aspirin reduces the risk of heart attacks in men, discussed the issue of when to do or not to do a randomized trial. Here are his words:</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_149" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">149</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-58" block_type="EXT-TXT"><em>On the one hand, there must be sufficient belief in the agent&#8217;s potential to justify exposing half the subjects to it.

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-59" block_type="TXT">Why is it ethical to give a control group of patients a placebo? Well, we know that placebos often work. Patients on placebos often show real improvement. What is more, placebos have no harmful side effects. So in the state of balancing belief and doubt described by Dr. Hennekens, the placebo group may be getting a better treatment than the drug group. If we <em>knew</em> which treatment was better, we would give it to everyone. When we don&#8217;t know, it is ethical to try both and compare them. Here are some harder questions about placebos, with arguments on both sides.</p>

<li id="scc9e-ch07-li-05"><p id="scc9e-ch07-p-63" block_type="EXP-UL"><strong>No</strong>: It isn&#8217;t ethical to deliberately give patients an inferior treatment. We don&#8217;t know whether the new drug is better than the existing drug, so it is ethical to give both in order to find out. If past trials showed that the existing drug is better than a placebo, it is no longer right to give patients a placebo. After all, the existing drug includes the placebo effect. A placebo group is ethical only if the existing drug is an older one that did not undergo proper clinical trials or doesn&#8217;t work well or is dangerous.</p></li>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-66" block_type="EXP-ni">&#8220;Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are the gold standard for evaluating new interventions and are routinely used to assess new medical therapies.&#8221; So says an article in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> that discusses the treatment of Parkinson&#8217;s disease. The article isn&#8217;t about the new treatment, which offers hope of reducing the tremors and lack of control brought on by the disease, but about the ethics of studying the treatment.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-67" block_type="EXP-mid">The law requires well-designed experiments to show that new drugs work and are safe. Not so with surgery&#8212;only about 7&#37; of studies of surgery use randomized comparisons. Surgeons think their operations succeed, but innovators always think their innovations work. Even if the patients are helped, the placebo effect may deserve most of the credit. So we don&#8217;t really know whether many common surgeries are worth the risk they carry. To find out, do a proper experiment. That includes a &#8220;sham surgery&#8221; to serve as a placebo. In the case of Parkinson&#8217;s disease, the promising treatment involves surgery to implant new cells. The placebo subjects get the same surgery, but the cells are not implanted.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-68" block_type="EXP-mid">Placebos work. Patients on placebos often show improvement and their inclusion produces a better experiment. As more doctors recognize this fact, more begin to ask, &#8220;If we accept a placebo in drug trials, why don&#8217;t we accept it in surgery trials?&#8221; This is a very controversial question. Here are two arguments about whether placebos should be used in surgery trials.</p>
<list id="scc9e-ch07-list-03" type="unordered" block_type="none">
<li id="scc9e-ch07-li-06"><p id="scc9e-ch07-p-69" block_type="EXP-UL1F"><strong>Yes</strong>: Most surgeries have not been tested in comparative experiments, and some are no doubt just placebos. Unlike placebo pills, these surgeries carry risks. Comparing real surgeries to placebo surgeries can eliminate thousands of unnecessary operations and save many lives. The placebo surgery can be made quite safe. For example, placebo patients can be given a safe drug that removes their memory of the operation rather than a more risky anesthetic required for the more serious real surgery. Subjects are told that they are in a placebo-controlled trial, and they agree to take part. Placebo-controlled trials of surgery are ethical (except for life-threatening conditions) if the risk to the placebo group is small and there is informed consent.</p></li>
<li id="scc9e-ch07-li-07"><p id="scc9e-ch07-p-70" block_type="EXP-UL"><strong>No</strong>: Placebo surgery, unlike placebo drugs, always carries some risk, such as postoperative infection. Remember that &#8220;the interests of the subject must always prevail.&#8221; Even great future benefits can&#8217;t justify risks to subjects today unless those subjects receive some benefit. We might give a patient a placebo drug as a medical therapy because placebos work and are not risky. No doctor would do a sham surgery as ordinary therapy because there is some risk. If we would not use it in medical practice, it isn&#8217;t ethical to use it in a clinical trial. </p></li>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-74" block_type="BX3-TXT-ni">We have pointed to the ethical problems of experiments with human subjects, clinical trials in particular. <em>Not</em> doing proper experiments can also pose problems. Here is an example. Women with advanced breast cancer will eventually die. A promising but untried treatment appears.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-75" block_type="BX3-TXT">The promising treatment is &#8220;bone marrow transplant&#8221; (BMT for short). The idea of BMT is to harvest a patient&#8217;s bone marrow cells, blast the cancer with very high doses of drugs, then return the harvested cells to keep the drugs from killing the patient. BMT has become popular, but it is painful, expensive, and dangerous.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-76" block_type="BX3-TXT">New anticancer drugs are first available through clinical trials, but there is no constraint on therapies such as BMT. When small, uncontrolled trials seemed to show success, BMT became widely available. The economics of medicine had a lot to do with this. The early leaders in offering BMT were for-profit hospitals that advertise heavily to attract patients. Others soon jumped in. <em>The New York Times</em> reported: &#8220;Every entity offering the experimental procedure tried a different sales pitch. Some promoted the prestige of their institutions, others the convenience of their locations, others their caring attitudes and patient support.&#8221; The profits for hospitals and doctors are high.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-77" block_type="BX3-TXT">Should we have waited for controlled clinical trials to show that the treatment works, or was it right to make it available immediately? What do you think? What are some of the issues that should be considered?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-94" block_type="EXP-ni">How should police respond to domestic violence calls? In the past, the usual practice was to remove the offender and order the offender to stay out of the household overnight. Police were reluctant to make arrests because the victims rarely pressed charges. Women&#8217;s groups argued that arresting offenders would help prevent future violence even if no charges were filed. Is there evidence that arrest will reduce future offenses? That&#8217;s a question that experiments have tried to answer.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-95" block_type="EXP-mid">A typical domestic violence experiment compares two treatments: arrest the suspect and hold him overnight or warn the suspect and release him. When police officers reach the scene of a domestic violence call, they calm the participants and investigate. Weapons or death threats require an arrest. If the facts permit an arrest but do not require it, an officer radios headquarters for instructions. The person on duty opens the next envelope in a file prepared in advance by a statistician. The envelopes contain the treatments in random order. The police either arrest the suspect or warn and release him, depending on the contents of the envelope. The researchers then monitor police records and visit the victim to see if the domestic violence reoccurs.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-96" block_type="EXP-mid">The first such experiment appeared to show that arresting domestic violence suspects does reduce their future violent behavior. As a result of this evidence, arrest has become the common police response to domestic violence. </p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-97" block_type="TXT">The domestic violence experiments shed light on an important issue of public policy. Because there is no informed consent, the ethical rules that govern clinical trials and most social science studies would forbid these experiments. They were cleared by review boards because, in the words of one domestic violence researcher, &#8220;These people became subjects by committing acts that allow the police to arrest them. You don&#8217;t need consent to arrest someone.&#8221;</p>

In real-world applications of statistics, these must be addressed as part of the process of reasoning from data to a conclusion. The principles discussed in this chapter are a good start in addressing these questions, but many ethical debates remain, especially in the area of experiments with humans. Many of the debates concern the right balance between the welfare of the subjects and the future benefits of the experiment. Remember that randomized comparative experiments can answer questions that can&#8217;t be answered without them.

There are strong side effects, and patients must be able to take more than a dozen pills on time every day.

For example, satellite weather data produced by the U.S. National Weather Service are available free to TV stations for their weather reports and to anyone on the Web. <em>Opinion 1: Government data should be available to everyone at minimal cost.</em> European governments, on the other hand, charge TV stations for weather data. <em>Opinion 2: The satellites are expensive, and the TV stations are making a profit from their weather services, so they should share the cost.</em> Which opinion do you support, and why?</p>

Males who said Yes were then asked, &#8220;That very first time that you had sexual intercourse with a female, how old were you?&#8221; and &#8220;Please tell me the name or initials of your first sexual partner so that I can refer to her during the interview.&#8221; Should consent of parents be required to ask minors about sex, drugs, and other such issues, or is consent of the minors themselves enough? Give reasons for your opinion.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-197" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.37 Deceiving subjects.</phrase> Students sign up to be subjects in a psychology experiment. When they arrive, they are placed in a room and assigned a task. During the task, the subject hears a loud thud from an adjacent room and then a piercing cry for help. Some subjects are placed in a room by themselves. Others are placed in a room with &#8220;confederates&#8221; who have been instructed by the researcher to look up upon hearing the cry, then return to their task. The treatments being compared are whether the subject is alone in the room or in the room with confederates. Will the subject ignore the cry for help?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-198" block_type="CR-X-NL">The students had agreed to take part in an unspecified study, and the true nature of the experiment is explained to them afterward. Do you think this study is ethically okay?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-200" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">7.38 Tempting subjects.</phrase> A psychologist conducts the following experiment: he measures the attitude of subjects toward cheating, then has them take a mathematics skills exam in which the subjects are tempted to cheat. Subjects are told that high scores will receive a &#36;100.00 gift certificate and that the purpose of the experiment is to see if rewards affect performance. The exam is computer-based and multiple choice. Subjects are left alone in a room with a computer on which the exam is available and are told that they are to click on the answer they believe is correct. However, when subjects click on an answer, a small pop-up window appears with the correct answer indicated. When the pop-up window is closed, it is possible to change the answer selected. The computer records&#8212;unknown to the subjects&#8212;whether or not they change their answers after closing the pop-up window. After completing the exam, attitude toward cheating is retested.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-201" block_type="CR-X-NL">Subjects who cheat tend to change their attitudes to find cheating more acceptable. Those who resist the temptation to cheat tend to condemn cheating more strongly on the second test of attitude. These results confirm the psychologist&#8217;s theory.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch07-p-202" block_type="CR-X-NL">This experiment tempts subjects to cheat. The subjects are led to believe that they can cheat secretly when, in fact, they are observed. Is this experiment ethically objectionable? Explain your position.</p>
