two&#150;way table
A table that displays the relationship between two categorical variables.
row variable
The categorical variable described in each horizontal row of a two&#150;way table.
column variable
The categorical variable described in each vertical column of a two&#150;way table.
expected counts
When testing <i>H</i><sub>0</sub>, the counts we would expect in a two&#150;way table, except for random variation, if <i>H</i><sub>0</sub> were true. This can be computed using the following formula&#58; expectedcounts.jpg
chi&#150;square statistic
A measure of how far the observed counts in a two&#150;way table are from the expected counts. It is denoted as &#967;<sup>2</sup> and can be calculated using the following formula&#58; chisquarestatistic.jpg
chi&#150;square distribution
The sampling distribution of the chi&#150;square statistic when the null hypothesis of no association is true. This type of distribution is not Normal. It takes only nonnegative values and is skewed to the right.
degrees of freedom
A number used to specify a specific chi&#150;square distribution.
chi&#150;square test
Tells us whether an observed association in a two&#150;way table is statistically significant. For a two&#150;way table with <i>r</i> rows and <i>c</i> columns, this uses critical values from the chi&#150;square distribution with &#40;<i>r</i> &#151; 1&#41;&#40;<i>c</i> &#151; 1&#41; degrees of freedom.
Simpson's paradox
The situation in which an association or comparsion that holds for all of several groups can disappear or even reverse direction when the data are combined to form a single group.
