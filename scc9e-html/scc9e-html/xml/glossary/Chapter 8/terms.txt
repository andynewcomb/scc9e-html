measurement
The assignment of a number to some property of an individual.
instrument
A tool used to make a measurement.
valid measurement
When a variable is relevant or appropriate as a representation of a property.
rate
Expressed as a fraction, a percentage, or a proportion, this is often a more valid measure than a simple count of occurrences.
predictive validity
When the measurement of a property can be used to predict success on tasks that are related to the property measured.
random error
This occurs when repeated measurements on the same individual give different results.
reliable measurement
When the random error in a measurement process is small.
variance
A quantity that is used to determine if the random error associated with a measurement is small.
average
In terms of measurement, the mean of several repeated measurements of the same individual. This is considered less variable, and thus more reliable, than a single measurement.
