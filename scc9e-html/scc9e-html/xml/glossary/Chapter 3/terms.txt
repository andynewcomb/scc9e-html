parameter
A number that describes a population. It is a fixed number, but in practice we don't know the actual value of this number.
statistic
A number that describes a sample. This is a known value when we have taken a sample, but it can change from sample to sample. It is often used to estimate an unknown parameter.
bias
Consistent, repeated deviation of the sample statistic from the population parameter in the same direction when we take many samples.
variability
Describes how spread out the values of the sample statistic are when we take many samples.
margin of error
Says how close the sample statistic lies to the population parameter.
level of confidence
Says what percentage of all possible samples satisfy the margin of error.
confidence statement
A statement that says how accurate our conclusions about the population are. The statement itself is comprised of the margin of error and the level of confidence.
preelection poll
A sample survey that asks people how they will vote in the future. Because people often change their minds before the election, these polls are not very reliable.
exit poll
A poll in which voters are interviewed as they are leaving the voting place.
