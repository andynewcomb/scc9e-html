regression
The name for statistical methods that fit some model to data in order to predict a response variable from one or more explanatory variables.
regression line
A straight line that describes how a response variable <i>y</i> changes as an explanatory variable <i>x</i> changes. This line is often used to predict the value of <i>y</i> for a given value of <i>x</i>.
least&#150;squares regression line
The line that makes the sum of the squares of the vertical distances of the data points from the line as small as possible.
slope
Denoted as <i>b</i> in the regression line equation <i>y</i> &#61; <i>a</i> &#43; <i>bx</i>, this is the amount by which <i>y</i> changes when <i>x</i> increases by one unit.
intercept
Denoted as <i>a</i> in the regression line equation <i>y</i> &#61; <i>a</i> &#43; <i>bx</i>, this is the value of <i>y</i> when <i>x</i> &#61; 0.
square of the correlation
Denoted as <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>, this is the proportion of the variation in the values of <i>y</i> that is explained by the least&#150;squares regression of <i>y</i> on <i>x</i>.
extrapolation
The use of a regression line for prediction for values outside of the range of data from which the regression line was calculated. This is risky because the pattern may be different there.
causation
An explanation regarding the observed relationship between two variables <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, in which by changing <i>x</i> &#40;the explanatory variable&#41; we can bring about a change in <i>y</i> &#40;the response variable&#41;.
common response
When both the explanatory and the response variable are responding to some lurking variable, and thus there appears to be an association even though there is no direct connection between <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.
confounded
Two variables are said to be this when their effects on a response variable cannot be distinguished from each other.
