median
The midpoint of a distribution&#59; the number such that half the observations are smaller and the other half are larger. It is often denoted as <i>M</i> and can be found in a set of data, when all observations are arranged in order from smallest to largest, by counting &#40;<i>n</i> &#43; 1&#41;&#47;2 observations up from the bottom of the list.
quartile
With the median, the value that divides the observations in a distribution into quarters. One&#150;quarter of the observations fall below the first quartile, which is denoted as <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>. Three&#150;quarters of the observations fall below the third quartile, which is denoted as <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>.
minimum
The smallest observation in a data set.
maximum
The largest observation in a data set.
five&#150;number summary
A description of a distribution that consists of the smallest observation &#40;minimum&#41;, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the largest observation &#40;maximum&#41;. These numbers are written in order from smallest to largest. In symbols, it is&#58; Minimum   <i>Q</i><sub>1</sub>   <i>M</i>   <i>Q</i><sub>3</sub>   Maximum
boxplot
A graph of the five&#150;number summary. A central box spans the quartiles. A line in the box marks the median. Lines extend from the box out to the smallest and largest observations.
mean
The arithmetic average of a set of observations.
standard deviation
Denoted <i>s</i> and used to measure variability, this measures the average distance of the observations in a distribution from their mean. This can be calculated by finding an average of the squared distances from the mean and then taking the square root.
variance
The average squared distance of the observations in a distribution from their mean. Also referred to as the square of the standard deviation.
