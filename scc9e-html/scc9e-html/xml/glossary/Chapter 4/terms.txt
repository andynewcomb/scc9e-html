sampling errors
Errors that are caused by the act of taking a sample. These errors may cause sample results to be different from the results of a census.
random sampling error
The deviation between the sample statistic and the population parameter caused by chance in selecting a random sample. The margin of error in a confidence statement includes <i>only</i> this type of error.
nonsampling errors
Errors that are not related to the act of selecting a sample from the population. They can be present even in a census.
sampling frame
A list of individuals from which one draws a sample.
undercoverage
When some groups in a population are left out of the process of choosing a sample.
processing error
A type of nonsampling error that involves mistakes in mechanical tasks such as doing arithmetic or entering responses into a computer.
response error
A type of nonsampling error that occurs when a subject gives an incorrect response. In this case, the subject's response may be a lie, the subject may remember incorrectly, or the subject may guess at an answer without fully understanding the question.
nonresponse
The failure to obtain data from an individual selected for a sample. This could be because the subject does not cooperate, or because the subject could not be contacted.
strata
A collection of individuals that are grouped together based on a determined similarity.
cluster
A collection of individuals who are grouped together based on location.
probability sample
A sample chosen by chance.
stratified random sample
A sample in which the sampling frame is first divided into various strata. A simple random sample is then taken in each of these strata, with those selected combined to form the complete sample.
