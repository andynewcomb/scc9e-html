<p id="scc9e-ch15-p05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">There are some surprising methods. The &#8220;Super Bowl Indicator&#8221; says that the football Super Bowl, played in January or early February, predicts how stocks will behave each year. The current National Football League (NFL) was formed by merging the original NFL with the American Football League (AFL). The current NFL consists of two conferences, the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The indicator claims that stocks go up in years when a team from the NFC (or from the old NFL) wins and down when an AFC team wins. The indicator was right in 39 of 49 years between the first Super Bowl in 1967 and 2015. (For purposes of the legend, we will regard the Baltimore Ravens as an old NFL team because they were the Cleveland Browns before the franchise moved to Baltimore in 1996. We will also regard the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an NFC team, although they were neither a pre-merger team nor an old NFL team and started out as an AFC team.) The indicator is right more than 75&#37; of the time, which seems impressive.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p06" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">In 2016 (the year in which this was written), the Broncos, an AFC team, won the Super Bowl. According to the Super Bowl Indicator, stocks will fall in 2016. Should I have avoided investing in 2016?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p07" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">In this chapter, we will study statistical methods to predict one variable from others that go well beyond just counting ups and downs. We will also distinguish between the ability to predict one variable from others and the issue of whether changes in one variable are caused by changes in others. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to critically evaluate the Super Bowl Indicator.</p>

Because we want to predict <em>y</em> from <em>x</em>, we want a line that is close to the points in the <em>vertical</em> (<em>y</em>) direction. It is hard to concentrate on just the vertical distances when drawing a line by eye. What is more, drawing by eye gives us a line on the graph but not an equation for the line. We need a way to find from the data the equation of the line that comes closest to the points in the vertical direction. There are many ways to make the collection of vertical distances &#8220;as small as possible.&#8221; The most common is the <em>least-squares</em> method.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p043" block_type="TXT-ni">Computers make prediction easy and automatic, even from very large sets of data. Anything that can be done automatically is often done thoughtlessly. Regression software will happily fit a straight line to a curved relationship, for example. Also, the computer cannot decide which is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable. This is important because the same data give two different lines depending on which is the explanatory variable.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p044" block_type="TXT">In practice, we often use several explanatory variables to predict a response. As part of its admissions process, a college might use SAT Math and Verbal scores and high school grades in English, math, and science (five explanatory variables) to predict first-year college grades. Although the details are messy, all statistical methods of predicting a response share some basic properties of least-squares regression lines.</p>

These forecasts depend on future economic trends (unknown) and on what Congress will decide about taxes and spending (also unknown).

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p060" block_type="EXP-first">Look again at <link href="figure_15_1.html">Figure 15.1</link>. There is a lot of variation in the humerus lengths of these five fossils, from a low of 41 cm to a high of 84 cm. The scatterplot shows that we can explain almost all of this variation by looking at femur length and at the regression line. As femur length increases, it pulls humerus length up with it along the line. There is very little leftover variation in humerus length, which appears in the scatter of points about the line. Because <em>r</em> = 0.994 for these data, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = (0.994)<sup>2</sup> = 0.988. So, the variation &#8220;along the line&#8221; as femur length pulls humerus length with it accounts for 98.8&#37; of all the variation in humerus length. The scatter of the points about the line accounts for only the remaining 1.2&#37;. Little leftover scatter says that prediction will be accurate.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p061" block_type="EXP-mid">Contrast the voting data in<link href="figure_15_2.html">Figure 15.2</link>. There is still a straight-line relationship between the 1980 and 1984 Democratic votes, but there is also much more scatter of points about the regression line. Here, <em>r</em> = 0.704 and so <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.496. Only about half the observed variation in the 1984 Democratic vote is explained by the straight-line pattern. You would still guess a higher 1984 Democratic vote for a state that was 45&#37; Democratic in 1980 than for a state that was only 30&#37; Democratic in 1980. But lots of variation remains in the 1984 votes of states with the same 1980 vote. That is the other half of the total variation among the states in 1984. It is due to other factors, such as differences in the main issues in the two elections and the fact that President Reagan&#8217;s two Democratic opponents came from different parts of the country.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p062" block_type="TXT">In reporting a regression, it is usual to give <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> as a measure of how successful the regression was in explaining the response. When you see a correlation, square it to get a better feel for the strength of the association. Perfect correlation a <em>r</em> = &#x2212;1 or <em>r</em> = 1) means the points lie exactly on a line. Then, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 1 and all of the variation in one variable is accounted for by the straight-line relationship with the other variable. If <em>r</em> = &#x2212;0.7 or <em>r</em> = 0.7, <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.49 and about half the variation is accounted for by the straight-line relationship. In the <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> scale, correlation &#177;0.7 is about halfway between 0 and &#177;1.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p080" block_type="EXP-mid">The results of a study of Mexican American girls aged 9 to 12 years are typical. Researchers measured body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, for both the girls and their mothers. People with high BMI are overweight or obese. They also measured hours of television watched, minutes of physical activity, and intake of several kinds of food. The result: the girls&#8217; BMIs were weakly correlated with physical activity (<em>r</em> = &#x2212;0.18), diet, and television. The strongest correlation (<em>r</em> = 0.506) was between the BMI of daughters and the BMI of their mothers.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p081" block_type="TXT">Body type is in part determined by heredity. Daughters inherit half their genes from their mothers.

Then John Lott, a University of Chicago economist, did an elaborate statistical study using data from all 3054 counties in the United States over the 18-year period from 1977 to 1994. Lott found that as states relaxed gun laws to allow adults to carry guns, the crime rate dropped.

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0114" block_type="TXT-ni">In 2008, researchers at Google were able to track the spread of influenza across the United States much faster than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By using computer algorithms to explore millions of online Internet searches, the researchers discovered a correlation between what people searched for online and whether they had flu symptoms. The researchers used this correlation to make their surprisingly accurate predictions.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0115" block_type="TXT">Massive databases, or &#8220;big data,&#8221; that are collected by Google, Facebook, credit card companies, and others contain petabytes&#8212;or <m:math display='inline'><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>15</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup></m:mrow></m:math> bytes&#8212; of data and continue to grow in size. Big data allow researchers, businesses, and industry to search for correlations and patterns in data that will enable them to make accurate predictions about public health, economic trends, or consumer behavior. Using big data to make predictions is increasingly common. Big data explored with clever algorithms open exciting possibilities. Will the experience of Google become the norm?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0117" block_type="TXT">Proponents for big data often make the following claims for its value. First, big data include all members of a population, eliminating the need for statistical sampling. Second, there is no need to worry about causation because correlations are all we need to know for making accurate predictions. Third, scientific and statistical theory is unnecessary because, with enough data, the numbers speak for themselves.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0118" block_type="TXT">Are these claims correct? First, as we saw in <link href="scc9e-ch03.xml">Chapter 3</link>, it is true that sampling variability is reduced by increasing the sample size and will become negligible with a sufficiently large sample. It is also true that there is no sampling variability when one has information on the entire population of interest. However, sampling variability is not the only source of error in statistics computed from data. Bias is another source of error and is not eliminated because the sample size is extremely large. Big data are often enormous convenience samples, the result of recording huge numbers of web searches, credit card purchases, or mobile phones pinging the nearest phone tower. This is not equivalent to having information about the entire population of interest. For example, in principle, it is possible to record every message on Twitter and use these data to draw conclusions about public opinion. However, Twitter users are not representative of the population as a whole. According to the Pew Research Internet Project, in 2013, U.S.-based users were disproportionally young, urban or suburban, and black. In other words, the large amount of data generated by Twitter users is biased when the goal is to draw conclusions about public opinion of all adults in the United States.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0119" block_type="TXT">Second, it is true that correlation can be exploited for purposes of prediction even if there is no causal relation between explanatory and response variables. However, if you have no idea what is behind a correlation, you have no idea what might cause prediction to fail, especially when one exploits the correlation to extrapolate to new situations. For a few winters after their success in 2008, Google Flu Trends continued to accurately track the spread of influenza using the correlations they discovered. But during the 2012&#8211;2013 flu season, data from the CDC showed that Google&#8217;s estimate of the spread of flu-like illnesses was overstated by almost a factor of two. A possible explanation was that the news was full of stories about the flu, and this provoked Internet searches by people who were otherwise healthy. The failure to understand why search terms were correlated with the spread of flu resulted in incorrectly assuming previous correlations extrapolated into the future.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0121" block_type="TXT">Adding to the perception of the infallibility of big data are news reports touting successes, with few reports of the failures. The claim that theory is unnecessary because the numbers speak for themselves is misleading when all the numbers concerning successes and failures of big data are not reported. Statistical theory has much to say that can prevent data analysts from making serious errors. Providing examples of where mistakes have been made and explaining how, with proper statistical understanding and tools, those mistakes could have been avoided is an important contribution.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0122" block_type="TXT">The era of big data is exciting and challenging and has opened incredible opportunities for researchers, businesses, and industry. But simply being big does not exempt big data from statistical pitfalls such as bias and extrapolation.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0130" block_type="SUM-TXT-ni"><image asset-id="scc9e-ch15-img-011" alt="image" src="images/LinkIt.jpg"/>In <link href="scc9e-ch14.xml">Chapter 14</link>, we used scatterplots and the correlation to explore and describe the relationship between two quantitative variables. In this chapter, we looked carefully at fitting a straight line to data in a scatterplot when there appears to be a straight-line trend, and then we used this line to predict the response from the explanatory variable. In doing this, we have used data to draw conclusions. We assume that the straight line that we fit to our data describes the actual relationship between the response and the explanatory variable and, thus, that conclusions (predictions) about additional values of the response based on other values of the explanatory variable are valid.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_356" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">356</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0132" block_type="TXT">Are these conclusions (predictions) justified? The squared correlation provides information about the likelihood of a successful prediction. Small values of the squared correlation suggest that our predictions are not likely to be accurate. Extrapolation is another setting in which our predictions are not likely to be accurate.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch15-p0133" block_type="TXT">Finally, when there is a strong relationship between two variables, it is tempting to draw an additional conclusion: namely, that changes in one variable cause changes in another. However, the case for causation requires more than a strong relationship. Unless our data are produced by a proper experiment, the case for causation is difficult to prove.</p>
