<p id="scc9e-ch16-p04" block_type="BX4-TXT-first"><phrase block_type="BX4-H-ri">CASE STUDY</phrase> The three career home run leaders are Barry Bonds (762 career home runs at the end of the 2007 season), Hank Aaron (755 career home runs), and Babe Ruth (714 career home runs). In <link href="scc9e-ch12.xml">Chapter 12</link>, we compared the careers of these sluggers using the five-number summary and boxplots. We pay for what we value, so another way to compare these players is by their salaries. Bonds&#8217;s highest salary was &#36;22,000,000 in 2005. Aaron&#8217;s highest salary was &#36;250,000 in 1976. And Ruth&#8217;s highest salary was &#36;80,000 in 1931.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Bonds&#8217;s highest salary is by far the largest. Does this mean he is clearly the best of the three? We know that a dollar in 1931 bought a lot more than a dollar in 1976, and both bought more than a dollar in 2005. Maybe in terms of buying power, Aaron&#8217;s or Ruth&#8217;s salary is highest.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p06" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">In this chapter, we discuss methods for comparing the buying power of the dollar across different years. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to determine whether Bonds, Aaron, or Ruth had the highest salary in terms of buying power.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p07" block_type="TXT-ni">We all notice the high salaries paid to professional athletes. In Major League Baseball, for example, the mean salary rose from &#36;329,408 in 1984 to &#36;3,386,212 in 2015. That&#8217;s a big jump. Not as big as it first appears, however. <em>A dollar in 2015 did not buy as much as a dollar in 1984, so 1984 salaries cannot be directly compared with 2015 salaries</em>. The hard fact that the dollar has steadily lost buying power over time means that we must make an adjustment whenever we compare dollar values from different years. The adjustment is easy. What is not easy is measuring the changing buying power of the dollar. The government&#8217;s Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the tool we need.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p09" block_type="TXT-ni">The CPI is a new kind of numerical description, an <em>index number.</em> We can attach an index number to any quantitative variable that we measure repeatedly over time. The idea of the index number is to give a picture of changes in a variable much like that drawn by saying, &#8220;The average cost of hospital charges rose 90.2&#37; between 2000 and 2010.&#8221; That is, an index number describes the percentage change from a <em>base period.</em></p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p068" block_type="TXT">Knowing the base period is essential to making sense of an index number. Because the index number for the base period is always 100, it is usual to identify the base period as 1994 by writing &#8220;1994 = 100.&#8221; In news reports concerning the CPI, you will notice the mysterious equation &#8220;1982&#8211;84 = 100.&#8221; That&#8217;s shorthand for the fact that the years 1982 to 1984 are the base period for the CPI. An index number just gives the current value as a percentage of the base value. Index number 271.1 means 271.1&#37; of the base value, or a 171.1&#37; increase from the base value. Index number 57 means that the current value is 57&#37; of the base, a 43&#37; decrease.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p069" block_type="TXT-ni">It may seem that index numbers are little more than a plot to disguise simple statements in complex language. Why say, &#8220;The Consumer Price Index (1982&#8211;84 = 100) stood at 238.7 in July 2015,&#8221; instead of &#8220;Consumer prices rose 138.7&#37; between the 1982&#8211;84 average and July 2015&#8221;? In fact, the term &#8220;index number&#8221; usually means more than a measure of change relative to a base. It also tells us the kind of variable whose change we measure. That variable is a weighted average of several quantities, with fixed weights. Let&#8217;s illustrate the idea by a simple price index.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p091" block_type="TXT">The basic idea of a fixed market basket price index is that the weight given to each component (salt, kerosene, welding) remains fixed over time. The CPI is, in essence, a fixed market basket price index, with several hundred items that represent all consumer purchases. Holding the market basket fixed allows a legitimate comparison of prices because we compare the prices of exactly the same items at each time. As we will see, it also poses severe problems for the CPI.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p092" block_type="TXT-ni">For now, think of the CPI as an index number for the cost of everything that American consumers buy. That the CPI for July 2015 was 238.7 means that we must spend &#36;238.7 in July 2015 to buy goods and services that cost &#36;100 in the 1982 to 1984 base period. An index number for &#8220;the cost of everything&#8221; lets us compare dollar amounts from different years by converting all the amounts into dollars of the same year. You will find tables in the <em>Statistical Abstract,</em> for example, with headings such as &#8220;Median Household Income, in Constant (2000) Dollars.&#8221; That table has restated all incomes in dollars that will buy as much as the dollar would buy in 2000. Watch for the term <em>constant dollars</em> and for phrases like <em>real income</em> or <em>real terms</em>. They mean that all dollar amounts represent the same buying power even though they may describe different years.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p094" block_type="TXT"><link href="table_16_1.html">Table 16.1</link> gives annual average CPIs from 1915 to 2014. <link href="figure_16_1.html">Figure 16.1</link> is a line graph of the <em>annual percentage increase</em> in CPI values. It shows that the periods from 1915 to 1920, the 1940s, and from 1975 to 1985 experienced high inflation. Although there is considerable variation, the annual percentage increase is positive in most years. In general, the twentieth century and the first ten years of the twenty-first century was a time of inflation. Faced with this depressing fact, it would be foolish to think about dollars without adjusting for their decline in buying power. Here is the recipe for converting dollars of one year into dollars of another year.</p>

In this case, the truth is that the fruits of prosperity since the 1980s went mostly to those at the top of the income distribution and that very little real progress was made by those at the bottom. Put another way, people with the highest pay (usually those with skills and education) did much better than people with the lowest pay (usually those who lack special skills and college educations). Economists suggest several reasons: the &#8220;new economy&#8221; that rewards knowledge, high immigration leading to competition for less-skilled jobs, more competition from abroad, and so on. Exactly why incomes at the top have increased so much, and what we should do about the stagnant incomes of those at the bottom, are controversial questions.</p>

<section-metadata><section-title>Understanding the CPI</section-title></section-metadata>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0203" block_type="TXT-ni">The idea of the CPI is that it is an index number for the cost of everything American consumers buy. That idea needs lots of adjusting to be practical. Much of the fiddling uses the results of large sample surveys.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0204" block_type="H3"><strong>Who is covered?</strong> The official name for the common version of the CPI (there are others, but we will ignore them) is the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The CPI market basket represents the purchases of people living in urban areas. The official definition of &#8220;urban&#8221; is broad so that about 80&#37; of the U.S. population is covered. But if you live on a farm, the CPI doesn&#8217;t apply to you.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0205" block_type="H3"><strong>How is the market basket chosen?</strong> Different households buy different things, so how can we get a single market basket? From a sample survey. The Consumer Expenditure Survey gathers detailed data on the spending of more than 30,000 households. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) breaks spending into categories such as &#8220;fresh fruits and vegetables,&#8221; &#8220;new and used motor vehicles,&#8221; and &#8220;hospital and related services.&#8221; Then it chooses specific items, such as &#8220;fresh oranges,&#8221; to represent each group in the market basket. The items in the market basket get weights that represent their category&#8217;s proportion of all spending. The weights, and even the specific market basket items, are updated regularly to keep up with changing buying habits. So the market basket isn&#8217;t actually fixed.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_375" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">375</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0207" block_type="H3"><strong>How are the prices determined?</strong> From more sample surveys. The BLS must discover the price of &#8220;fresh oranges&#8221; every month. That price differs from city to city and from store to store in the same city. Each month, the BLS records 80,000 prices in 87 cities at a sample of stores. The Point of Purchase Survey of 16,800 households keeps the BLS up-to-date on where consumers shop for each category of goods and services (supermarkets, convenience stores, discount stores, and so on).</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0208" block_type="H3"><strong>Does the CPI measure changes in the cost of living?</strong> A fixed market basket price index measures the cost of <em>living the same</em> over time, as <link href="example_16_2.html">Example 2</link> illustrated. In fact, we don&#8217;t keep buying the same market basket of goods and services over time. We switch from LP records to tapes and CDs and then to music downloads. We don&#8217;t buy new 1995 cars in 2005 or 2015. As prices change, we change what we buy&#8212;if beef becomes expensive, we buy less beef and more chicken or more tofu. A fixed market basket price index can&#8217;t accurately measure changes in the cost of living when the economy itself is changing.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0209" block_type="TXT">The BLS tries hard to keep its market basket up-to-date and to compensate for changes in quality. Every year, for example, the BLS must decide how much of the increase in new-car prices is paying for better quality. Only what&#8217;s left counts as a genuine price increase in calculating the CPI. Between December 1967 and December 1994, actual car prices went up 313.4&#37;, but the new-car price in the CPI went up only 172.1&#37;. In 1995, adjustments for better quality reduced the overall rise in the prices of goods and services from 4.7&#37; to only 2.2&#37;. Prices of goods and services make up about 70&#37; of the CPI. Most of the rest is the cost of shelter&#8212;renting an apartment or buying a house. House prices are another problem for the BLS. People buy houses partly to live in and partly because they think owning a house is a good investment. If we pay more for a house because we think it&#8217;s a good investment, the full price should not go into the CPI.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0210" block_type="TXT">By now it is clear that the CPI is <em>not</em> a fixed market basket price index, though that is the best way to start thinking about it. The BLS must constantly change the market basket as new products appear and our buying habits change. It must adjust the prices its sample surveys record to take account of better quality and the investment component of house prices. Yet the CPI still does not measure all changes in our cost of living. It leaves out taxes, for example, which are certainly part of our cost of living.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0214" block_type="BX3-TXT-ni">In 1995, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan estimated that the CPI overstates inflation by somewhere between 0.5&#37; and 1.5&#37; per year. Mr. Greenspan was unhappy about this because increases in the CPI automatically drive up federal spending. At the end of 1996, a group of outside experts appointed by the Senate Finance Committee estimated that the CPI had, in the past, overstated the rate of inflation by about 1.1&#37; per year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) agreed that the CPI overstates inflation but thought that the experts&#8217; guess of 1.1&#37; per year was too high.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0215" block_type="BX3-TXT">The reasons the CPI shows the value of a dollar falling faster than is true are due partly to the nature of the CPI and partly to limits on how quickly the BLS can adjust the details of the enormous machine that lies behind the CPI. Think first about the details. The prices of new products, such as digital cameras and flat-screen televisions, often start high and drop rapidly. The CPI market basket changes too slowly to capture the drop in price. Discount stores with lower prices also enter the CPI sample slowly. Although the BLS tries hard to adjust for better product quality, the outside experts thought these adjustments were often too little and too late. The BLS has made many improvements in these details (most recently, in February 2015). The improved CPI would have grown about 0.5&#37; per year more slowly than the actual CPI between 1978 and 1998.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0216" block_type="BX3-TXT">The wider issue is the nature of the CPI as essentially a fixed market basket index. What sort of bias does such an index create? Does it produce an upward bias; that is, does it overstate the cost of living? Or does it create a downward bias; that is, does it understate the cost of living? Why?</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0217" block_type="TXT">Even if we agree that the CPI should look only at the goods and services we buy, it doesn&#8217;t perfectly measure changes in our cost of living. In principle, a true &#8220;cost-of-living index&#8221; would measure the cost of the <em>same standard of living</em> over time. That&#8217;s why we start with a fixed market basket price index, which also measures the cost of living the same over time but takes the simple view that &#8220;the same&#8221; means buying exactly the same things. If we are just as satisfied after switching from beef to tofu to avoid paying more for beef, our standard of living hasn&#8217;t changed, and a cost-of-living index should ignore the higher price of beef. If we are willing to pay more for products that keep our environment clean, we are paying for a higher standard of living, and the index should treat this just like an improvement in the quality of a new car. The BLS says that it would like the CPI to track changes in the cost of living but that a true cost-of-living index isn&#8217;t possible in the real world.</p>

<p id="scc9e_page_377" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">377</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0219" block_type="TXT-ni">Modern nations run on statistics. Economic data, in particular, guide government policy and inform the decisions of private business and individuals. Price indexes and unemployment rates, along with many other, less publicized series of data, are produced by government statistical offices.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0220" block_type="TXT">Some countries have a single statistical office, such as Statistics Canada (<link href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca">www.statcan.gc.ca</link>). Others attach smaller offices to various branches of government. The United States is an extreme case: there are 72 federal statistical offices, with relatively weak coordination among them. The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics are the largest, but you may at times use the products of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the National Center for Health Statistics, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or others in the federal government&#8217;s collection of statistical agencies.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0221" block_type="TXT">A 1993 ranking of government statistical agencies by the heads of these agencies in several nations put Canada at the top, with the United States tied with Britain and Germany for sixth place. The top spots generally went to countries with a single, independent statistical office. In 1996, Britain combined its main statistical agencies to form a new Office for National Statistics (<link href="http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics">www.gov.uk/government/statistics</link>). U.S. government statistical agencies remain fragmented.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0222" block_type="TXT">What do citizens need from their government statistical agencies? First of all, they need data that are <em>accurate</em> and <em>timely</em> and that <em>keep up with changes in society and the economy</em>. Producing accurate data quickly demands considerable resources. Think of the large-scale sample surveys that produce the unemployment rate and the CPI. The major U.S. statistical offices have a good reputation for accuracy and lead the world in getting data to the public quickly. Their record for keeping up with changes is less impressive. The struggle to adjust the CPI for changing buying habits and changing quality is one issue. Another is the failure of U.S. economic statistics to keep up with trends such as the shift from manufacturing to services as the major type of economic activity. Business organizations have expressed strong dissatisfaction with the overall state of our economic data.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0223" block_type="TXT">Much of the difficulty stems from lack of money. In the years after 1980, reducing federal spending was a political priority. Government statistical agencies lost staff and cut programs. Lower salaries made it hard to attract the best economists and statisticians to government. The level of government spending on data also depends on our view of what data the government should produce. In particular, should the government produce data that are used mainly by private business rather than by the government&#8217;s own policymakers? Perhaps such data should be either compiled by private concerns or produced only for those who are willing to pay. This is a question of political philosophy rather than statistics, but it helps determine what level of government statistics we want to pay for.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_378" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">378</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0225" block_type="TXT"><em>Freedom from political influence</em> is as important to government statistics as accuracy and timeliness. When a statistical office is part of a government ministry, it can be influenced by the needs and desires of that ministry. The Census Bureau is in the Department of Commerce, which serves business interests. The BLS is in the Department of Labor. Thus, business and labor each has &#8220;its own&#8221; statistical office. The professionals in the statistical offices successfully resist direct political interference&#8212;a poor unemployment report is never delayed until after an election, for example. But indirect influence is clearly present. The BLS must compete with other Department of Labor activities for its budget, for example. Political interference with statistical work seems to be increasing, as when Congress refused to allow the Census Bureau to use sample surveys to correct for undercounting in the 2000 census. Such corrections are convincing to statisticians, but not necessarily to the general public. Congress, not without justification, considers the public legitimacy of the census to be as important as its technical perfection. Thus, from Congress&#8217;s point of view, political interference was justified even though the decision was disappointing to statisticians.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0226" block_type="TXT">The 1996 reorganization of Britain&#8217;s statistical offices was prompted in part by a widespread feeling that political influence was too strong. The details of how unemployment is measured in Britain were changed many times in the 1980s, for example, and almost all the changes had the effect of reducing the reported unemployment rate&#8212;just what the government wanted to see.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0227" block_type="TXT">We favor a single &#8220;Statistics USA&#8221; office not attached to any other government ministry, as in Canada. Such unification might also help the money problem by eliminating duplication. It would at least allow a central decision about which programs deserve a larger share of limited resources. Unification is unlikely, but stronger coordination of the many federal statistical offices could achieve many of the same ends.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0229" block_type="TXT-ni">National economic statistics are well established with the government, the media, and the public. The government also produces many data on social issues such as education, health, housing, and crime. Social statistics are less complete than economic statistics. We have good data about how much money is spent on food but less information about how many people are poorly nourished. Social data are also less carefully produced than economic data. Economic statistics are generally based on larger samples, are compiled more often, and are published with a shorter time lag. The reason is clear: economic data are used by the government to guide economic policy month by month. Social data help us understand our society and address its problems but are not needed for short-term management.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0230" block_type="TXT">There are other reasons the government is reluctant to produce social data. Many people don&#8217;t want the government to ask about their sexual behavior or religion. Many people feel that the government should avoid asking about our opinions&#8212;apparently it&#8217;s OK to ask, &#8220;When did you last visit a doctor?&#8221; but not &#8220;How satisfied are you with the quality of your health care?&#8221; These hesitations reflect the American suspicion of government intrusion. Yet issues such as sexual behaviors that contribute to the spread of HIV and satisfaction with health care are clearly important to citizens. Both facts and opinions on these issues can sway elections and influence policy. How can we get accurate information about social issues, collected consistently over time, and yet not entangle the government with sex, religion, and other touchy subjects?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0231" block_type="TXT">The solution in the United States has been government funding of university sample surveys. After first deciding to undertake a sample survey asking people about their sexual behavior, in part to guide AIDS policy, the government backed away. Instead, it funded a much smaller survey of 3452 adults by the University of Chicago&#8217;s National Opinion Research Center (NORC). NORC&#8217;s General Social Survey (GSS), funded by the government&#8217;s National Science Foundation, belongs with the Current Population Survey and the samples that undergird the CPI on any list of the most important sample surveys in the United States. The GSS includes both &#8220;fact&#8221; and &#8220;opinion&#8221; items. Respondents answer questions about their job security, their job satisfaction, and their satisfaction with their city, their friends, and their families. They talk about race, religion, and sex. Many Americans would object if the government asked whether they had seen an X-rated movie in the past year, but they reply when the GSS asks this question. The website for the GSS is <link href="http://gss.norc.org">gss.norc.org</link>.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_380" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">380</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0233" block_type="TXT">This indirect system of government funding of a university-based sample survey fits the American feeling that the government itself should not be unduly invasive. It also insulates the survey from most political pressure. Alas, the government&#8217;s budget cutting extends to the GSS, which now describes itself as an &#8220;almost annual&#8221; survey because lack of funds has prevented taking samples in some years. The GSS is, we think, a bargain.</p>

Because these index numbers, in particular the CPI, are used by the government and media to describe the cost of living, understanding how they are computed and what they represent will help us be better-informed citizens.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0365" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">16.30 Seasonal adjustment.</phrase> Like many government data series, the CPI is published in both unadjusted and seasonally adjusted forms. The BLS says that it &#8220;strongly recommends using indexes unadjusted for seasonal variation (i.e., not seasonally adjusted indexes) for escalation.&#8221; &#8220;Escalation&#8221; here means adjusting wage or other payments to keep up with changes in the CPI. Why is the unadjusted CPI preferred for this purpose?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0366" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">16.31 More CPIs.</phrase> In addition to the national CPI, the BLS publishes CPIs for four regions and for 37 local areas. Each regional and local CPI is based on just the part of the national sample of prices that applies to the region or local area. The BLS says that the local CPIs should be used with caution because they are much more variable than national or regional CPIs. Why is this?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch16-p0367" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">16.32 The poverty line.</phrase> The federal government announces &#8220;poverty lines&#8221; each year for households of different sizes. Households with income below the announced levels are considered to be living in poverty. An economist looked at the poverty lines over time and said that they &#8220;show a pattern of getting higher in real terms as the real income of the general population rises.&#8221; What does &#8220;getting higher in real terms&#8221; say about the official poverty level?</p>

However, workers at the 33rd percentile experienced a 14 percent drop in the real wage, workers at the 66th percentile experienced only a 6 percent drop, and workers in the upper tail of the distribution experienced a 1 percent wage increase.&#8221;</p>

We might, for example, cut the Current Population Survey from 50,000 households to 20,000. Explain clearly, to someone who knows no statistics, why such cuts reduce the accuracy of the resulting data.</p>
