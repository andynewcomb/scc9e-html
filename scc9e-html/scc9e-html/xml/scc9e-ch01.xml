What you listen to on the radio or on music streaming sites like Pandora is probably not what we listen to. Of course, we and our friends are also not typical. To get a true picture of the country as a whole (or even of college students), we must recognize that the picture may not resemble us or what we see around us. We need <em>data</em>. Data from Nielsen (a consumer research firm) for April 15, 2015, show that the most popular radio formats for millennials (ages 18&#8211;34) are pop contemporary hit radio (12.8&#37; of listeners) and country (9.0&#37; of listeners). If you like hot adult contemporary (7.5&#37; of listeners) and we like classic rock (4.8&#37; of listeners), we may have no clue about the tastes of radio audiences as a whole. If we are in the broadcasting business, or even if we are interested in pop culture, we must put our own tastes aside and look at the data.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-03" block_type="PO-TXT">You can find data in the library or on the Internet (that&#8217;s where we found the radio format data). But how can we know whether data can be trusted? Good data are as much a human product as wool sweaters and tablet PCs. Sloppily produced data will frustrate you as much as a sloppily made sweater. You examine a sweater before you buy, and you don&#8217;t buy if it is not well made. Neither should you use data that are not well made. The first part of this book shows how to tell if data are well made.</p>

No wonder algebra seems unconnected to life. You can&#8217;t go a day, however, without meeting data and statistical studies. You hear that last month&#8217;s unemployment rate was 5.4&#37;. A news article says that 88&#37; of AAAS (the American Association for the Advancement of Science) scientists agree that it is generally safe to eat genetically modified foods, while only 37&#37; of all U.S. residents 18 years of age and over agree. A longer article says that low-income children who received high-quality day care did better on academic tests given years later and were more likely to go to college and hold good jobs than other similar children.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-07" block_type="BX4-TXT-first">Where do these data come from? Why can we trust them? Or maybe we can&#8217;t trust them. Good data are the fruit of intelligent human effort. Bad data result from laziness or lack of understanding, or even the desire to mislead others. &#8220;Where do the data come from?&#8221; is the first question you should ask when someone throws a number at you.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-08" block_type="BX4-TXT-first">In 2012, Colorado voters legalized marijuana. Subsequently, voters in several other states have considered legalizing marijuana. One of these is Michigan. In February 2014, the Michigan online news site MLive ran the story &#8220;Take our online poll: Should Michigan legalize marijuana?&#8221; Of 9684 respondents, 7906 (81.64&#37;) said Yes, 1190 (12.29&#37;) said No, and 588 (6.07&#37;) said Decriminalize but not legalize. These results would seem to indicate overwhelming support for legalizing marijuana in Michigan.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-09" block_type="BX4-TXT-first">What can we say about data from this poll? By the end of this chapter you will have learned some basic questions to ask about the data from the MLive online poll. The answers to these questions will help us assess whether the data from the poll are good or bad, as we will explore further in <link href="scc9e-ch02.xml">Chapter 2</link>.</p>

Major and grade are categorical, and to do statistics with these variables, we use <em>counts</em> or <em>percentages</em>.

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-22" block_type="EXP-first">Who takes the trouble to recycle? Researchers spent lots of time and money weighing the stuff put out for recycling in two neighborhoods in a California city; call them Upper Crust and Lower Mid. The <em>individuals</em> here are households because trash and recycling pickup are done for residences, not for people one at a time. The <em>variable</em> measured was the weight in pounds of the curbside recycling basket each week.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-23" block_type="EXP-mid">The Upper Crust households contributed more pounds per week on the average than did the folk in Lower Mid. Can we say that the rich are more serious about recycling? No. Someone noticed that Upper Crust recycling baskets contained lots of heavy glass wine bottles. In Lower Mid, they put out lots of light plastic soda bottles and light metal beer and soda cans. The conclusion: weight tells us little about commitment to recycling.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-25" block_type="EXP-first">The U.S. census asks, &#8220;What is this person&#8217;s race?&#8221; for every person in every household. &#8220;Race&#8221; is a <em>variable</em>, and the Census Bureau must say exactly how to measure it. The census form does this by giving a list of races. Years of political squabbling lie behind this list.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-26" block_type="EXP-mid">How many races shall we list, and what names shall we use for them? Shall we have a category for people of mixed race? Asians wanted more national categories, such as Filipino and Vietnamese, for the growing Asian population. Pacific Islanders wanted to be separated from the larger Asian group. Black leaders did not want a mixed-race category, fearing that many blacks would choose it and so reduce the official count of the black population.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-27" block_type="EXP-mid">The 2010 census form (see <link href="figure_1_1.html">Figure 1.1</link>) ended up with six Asian groups (plus &#8220;Other Asian&#8221;) and three Pacific Island groups (plus &#8220;Other Pacific Islander&#8221;). There is no &#8220;mixed-race&#8221; group, but you can mark more than one race. That is, people claiming mixed race can count as both so that the total of the racial group counts in 2010 is larger than the population count. Unable to decide what the proper term for blacks should be, the Census Bureau settled on &#8220;Black, African American, or Negro.&#8221; What about Hispanics? That&#8217;s a separate question because Hispanics can be of any race. Again unable to choose a short name that would satisfy everyone, the Census Bureau decided to ask if you are of &#8220;Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.&#8221;</p>

To learn how chimpanzees in the wild behave, watch. To study how a teacher and young children interact in a schoolroom, watch. It helps if the watcher knows what to look for. The chimpanzee expert may be interested in how males and females interact, in whether some chimps in the troop are dominant, in whether the chimps hunt and eat meat. Indeed, chimps were thought to be vegetarians until Jane Goodall watched them carefully in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Now it is clear that meat is a natural part of the chimpanzee diet.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-30" block_type="TXT">At first, the observer may not know what to record. Eventually, patterns seem to emerge, and we can decide what variables we want to measure. How often do chimpanzees hunt? Alone or in groups? How large are hunting groups? Males alone, or both males and females? How much of the diet is meat? Observation that is organized and measures clearly defined variables is more convincing than just watching. Here is an example of highly organized (and expensive) observation.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-32" block_type="EXP-first">Electric currents generate magnetic fields. So, living with electricity exposes people to magnetic fields. Living near power lines increases exposure to these fields. Really strong fields can disturb living cells in laboratory studies. What about the weaker fields we experience if we live near power lines? Some data suggested that more children in these locations might develop leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-33" block_type="EXP-mid">We can&#8217;t do experiments that deliberately expose children to magnetic fields for weeks and months at a time. It&#8217;s hard to compare cancer rates among children who happen to live in more and less exposed locations because leukemia is quite rare and locations vary a lot in many ways other than magnetic fields. It is easier to start with children who have leukemia and compare them with children who don&#8217;t. We can look at lots of possible causes&#8212;diet, pesticides, drinking water, magnetic fields, and others&#8212;to see where children with leukemia differ from those without. Some of these broad studies suggested a closer look at magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_8" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">8</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-34" block_type="EXP-mid">One really careful look at magnetic fields took five years and cost &#36;5 million. The researchers compared 638 children who had leukemia and 620 who did not. They went into the homes and actually measured the magnetic fields in the children&#8217;s bedrooms, in other rooms, and at the front door. They recorded facts about nearby power lines for the family home and also for the mother&#8217;s residence when she was pregnant. Result: no evidence of more than a chance connection between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia. Similar conclusions were reached by researchers at the University of Oxford in England who reviewed data from 1962 to 2008.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-35" block_type="TXT">&#8220;No evidence&#8221; that magnetic fields are connected with childhood leukemia doesn&#8217;t prove that there is no risk. It says only that a very careful study could not find any risk that stands out from the play of chance that distributes leukemia cases across the landscape. In other words, the study could not rule out chance as a plausible explanation for what was observed. Critics continue to argue that the study failed to measure some important variables or that the children studied don&#8217;t fairly represent all children. Nonetheless, a carefully designed observational study is a great advance over haphazard and sometimes emotional counting of cancer cases.</p>

We usually reserve the dignified term &#8220;sample survey&#8221; for studies that use an organized plan to choose a sample that represents some specific population. The children with leukemia were patients at centers that specialize in treating children&#8217;s cancer. Expert judgment says they are typical of all leukemia patients, even though they come only from special types of hospitals. A sample survey doesn&#8217;t rely on judgment: it starts with an entire population and uses specific, quantifiable methods to choose a sample to represent the population. <link href="scc9e-ch02.xml">Chapters 2</link>, <link href="scc9e-ch03.xml">3</link>, and <link href="scc9e-ch04.xml">4</link> discuss the art and science of sample surveys.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-70" block_type="TXT">The U.S. Constitution requires a census of the American population every 10 years. A census of so large a population is expensive and takes a long time. Even the federal government, which can afford a census, uses samples such as the Current Population Survey to produce timely data on employment and many other variables. If the government asked every adult in the country about his or her employment, this month&#8217;s unemployment rate would be available next year rather than next month. In fact, to save money, the 2010 census consisted of only 10 questions. Five of these were general questions, and five required answers for every person living at the address the form was sent to.</p>

Technology marches on, however, and replacements for a national census look promising. Denmark has no census, and France plans to eliminate its census. Denmark has a national register of all its residents, who carry identification cards and change their register entry whenever they move. France will replace its census by a large sample survey that rotates among the nation&#8217;s regions. The U.S. Census Bureau has a similar idea: the American Community Survey has already started and has eliminated the census &#8220;long form.&#8221; Canada has eliminated its long-form census and replaced it with a controversial voluntary National Household Survey.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-71" block_type="TXT">So time and money favor samples over a census. Samples can have other advantages as well. If you are testing fireworks or fuses, the sampled items are destroyed. Moreover, a sample can produce more accurate data than a census. A careful sample of an inventory of spare parts will almost certainly give more accurate results than asking the clerks to count all 500,000 parts in the warehouse. Bored people do not count accurately.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-73" block_type="TXT">The experience of the Census Bureau reminds us that a census can only <em>attempt</em> to sample the entire population. The bureau estimated that the 2010 census overcounted the American population by 0.01&#37; but undercounted the black population by 2.1&#37;. A census is not foolproof, even with the resources of the government behind it. Why take a census at all? The government needs block-by-block population figures to create election districts with equal populations. The main function of the U.S. census is to provide this local information.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-79" block_type="EXP-first">The Urban Institute in Washington DC reports that most adult welfare recipients are single mothers in their 20s and 30s with one or two children. Observational studies of welfare mothers show that many are able to increase their earnings and leave the welfare system. Some take advantage of voluntary job-training programs to improve their skills. Should participation in job-training and job-search programs be required of all able-bodied welfare mothers? Observational studies of the current system cannot tell us what the effects of such a policy would be. Even if the mothers studied are a properly chosen sample of all welfare recipients, those who seek out training and find jobs may differ in many ways from those who do not. They are observed to have more education, for example, but they may also differ in values and motivation, things that cannot be observed.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-80" block_type="EXP-mid">To see if a required jobs program will help mothers escape welfare, such a program must actually be tried. Choose two similar groups of mothers when they apply for welfare. Require one group to participate in a job-training program, but do not offer the program to the other group. This is an experiment. Comparing the income and work record of the two groups after several years will show whether requiring training has the desired effect.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch01-p-83" block_type="TXT">The welfare example illustrates the big advantage of experiments over observational studies: <em>in principle, experiments can give good evidence for cause and effect</em>. If we design the experiment properly, we start with two very similar groups of welfare mothers. The <em>individual</em> women of course differ from each other in age, education, number of children, and other respects. But the two <em>groups</em> resemble each other when we look at the ages, years of education, and number of children for all women in each group. During the experiment, the women&#8217;s lives differ, but there is only one systematic difference between the two groups: whether or not they are in the jobs program. All live through the same good or bad economic times, the same changes in public attitudes, and so on. If the training group does much better than the untrained group in holding jobs and earning money, we can say that the training program actually causes this happy outcome.</p>

If <em>on the average</em> the women in the training program earned more than those who were left out, that says that the program achieved its goal. It doesn&#8217;t say that every woman in such a program will be helped.

The nature and validity of the conclusion are affected by this first step. Two sources of data are observational studies and experiments. Observational studies are best suited for a conclusion that involves describing some group or situation without disturbing the scene we observe. Sample surveys are a type of observational study in which we draw conclusions about a population by observing only a part of the population (the sample).

Since 1996, a team of British researchers has been gathering detailed information from 1.28 million women aged 50 to 64. The researchers recorded how much alcohol the women reported consuming when they volunteered for the study and again three years later. The researchers then examined whether there was any link with the 68,775 cancers the women developed over an average of the next seven years. They found that even among women who consumed as little as 10 grams of alcohol a day on average (the equivalent of about one drink), the risk for cancer of the breast, liver, and rectum was elevated.</p>
