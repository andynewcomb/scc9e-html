These rankings by <em>U.S. News &#38; World Report</em> are very influential in determining public opinion about the quality of the nation&#8217;s colleges and universities. However, critics of the rankings question the quality of the data used to rank schools. In the January 2012 article &#8220;Gaming the College Rankings,&#8221; the <em>New York Times</em> described several instances of &#8220;fudging the numbers&#8221; by colleges in order to climb in the rankings.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-5" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Business data, advertising claims, debate on public issues&#8212;we are assailed daily by numbers intended to prove a point, buttress an argument, or assure us that all is well. Sometimes, as the critics of the <em>U.S. News &#38; World Report</em> rankings maintain, we are fed fake data. Sometimes, people who use data to argue a cause care more for the cause than for the accuracy of the data. Others simply lack the skills needed to employ numbers carefully.

We also need &#8220;number sense,&#8221; the habit of asking if numbers make sense. Developing number sense is the purpose of this chapter. To help develop number sense, we will look at how bad data, or good data used wrongly, can mislead the unwary.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-16" block_type="EXP-first">Colleges know that many prospective students look at popular guidebooks to decide where to apply for admission. The guidebooks print information supplied by the colleges themselves. Surely no college would simply lie about, say, the average SAT score of its entering students or admission rates. But we do want our scores to look good and admission standards to appear high. What would happen if SAT scores were optional when applying for admission? Students with low scores will tend to not include them as part of their application so that average scores increase. In addition, the number of applicants increases, admittance rates decrease, and a college appears more selective.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-20" block_type="EXP-T"><phrase block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 4</phrase> The case of the missing vans</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-21" block_type="EXP-first">Auto manufacturers lend their dealers money to help them keep vehicles on their lots. The loans are repaid when the vehicles are sold. A Long Island auto dealer named John McNamara borrowed more than &#36;6 billion from General Motors between 1985 and 1991. In December 1990 alone, Mr. McNamara borrowed &#36;425 million to buy 17,000 GM vans customized by an Indiana company, allegedly for sale overseas. GM happily lent McNamara the money because he always repaid the loans.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_189" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">189</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-23" block_type="EXP-mid">Let&#8217;s pause to consider the numbers, as GM should have done but didn&#8217;t. At the time GM made this loan, the entire van-customizing industry produced only about 17,000 customized vans a month. So McNamara was claiming to buy an entire month&#8217;s production. These large, luxurious, and gas-guzzling vehicles are designed for U.S. interstate highways. The recreational vehicle trade association says that only 1.35&#37; (not quite 2800 vans) were exported in 1990. It&#8217;s not plausible to claim that 17,000 vans in a single month are being bought for export. McNamara&#8217;s claimed purchases were large even when compared with total production of vans. Chevrolet, for example, produced 100,067 full-sized vans in all of 1990.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-24" block_type="EXP-mid">Having looked at the numbers, you can guess the rest. McNamara admitted in federal court in 1992 that he was defrauding GM on a massive scale. The Indiana company was a shell company set up by McNamara, its invoices were phony, and the vans didn&#8217;t exist. McNamara borrowed vastly from GM, used most of each loan to pay off the previous loan (thus establishing a record as a good credit risk), and skimmed off a bit for himself. The bit he skimmed amounted to more than &#36;400 million. GM set aside &#36;275 million to cover its losses. Two executives, who should have looked at the numbers relevant to their business, were fired.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-25" block_type="TXT">John McNamara fooled General Motors because GM didn&#8217;t compare his numbers with others. No one asked how a dealer could buy 17,000 vans in a single month for export when the entire custom van industry produces just 17,000 vans a month and only a bit over 1&#37; are exported. Speaking of GM, here&#8217;s another example in which the numbers don&#8217;t line up with each other.</p>

In 1998, Ford&#8217;s Lincoln brand seemed to be winning until the last moment. Said the <em>New York Times,</em> &#8220;After reporting almost unbelievable sales results in December, Cadillac eked out a come-from-behind victory by just 222 cars.&#8221; The final count was 187,343 for Cadillac, 187,121 for Lincoln. Then GM reported that Cadillac sales dropped 38&#37; in January. How could sales be so different in December and January? Could it be that some January sales were counted in the previous year&#8217;s total? Just enough, say, to win by 222 cars? Yes, indeed. In May, GM confessed that it sold 4773 fewer Cadillacs in December than it had claimed.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-84" block_type="EXP-first">A highway billboard says simply, &#8220;Half of all heart disease victims are women.&#8221; What might be the agenda behind this true statement? Perhaps the billboard sponsors just want to make women aware that they do face risks from heart disease. (Surveys show that many women underestimate the risk of heart disease.)</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-85" block_type="EXP-mid">On the other hand, perhaps the sponsors want to fight what some people see as an overemphasis on male heart disease. In that case, we might want to know that although half of heart disease victims are women, they are on the average much older than male victims. Roughly 50,000 women under age 65 and 100,000 men under age 65 die from heart disease each year. The American Heart Association says, &#8220;Risk of death due to coronary heart disease in women is roughly similar to that of men 10 years younger.&#8221;</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-86" block_type="EXP-T"><phrase block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 14</phrase> Income inequality</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-87" block_type="EXP-first">During the economic boom of the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, the gap between the highest and lowest earners widened. In 1980, the bottom fifth of households received 4.3&#37; of all income, and the top fifth received 43.7&#37;. By 1998, the share of the bottom fifth had fallen to 3.6&#37; of all income, and the share of the top fifth of households had risen to 49.2&#37;. That is, the top fifth&#8217;s share was almost 14 times the bottom fifth&#8217;s share.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-88" block_type="EXP-mid">Can we massage the numbers to make it appear that the income gap is smaller than it actually is? An article in <em>Forbes</em> (a magazine read mainly by rich people) tried. First, according to data from the Current Population Survey, household income tends to be larger for larger households, so let&#8217;s change to income per person. The rich pay more taxes, so look at income after taxes. The poor receive food stamps and other assistance, so let&#8217;s count that. Finally, high earners work more hours than low earners, so we should adjust for hours worked. After all this, the share of the top fifth is only three times that of the bottom fifth. Of course, hours worked are reduced by illness, disability, care of children and aged parents, and so on. If <em>Forbes</em>&#8217;s hidden agenda is to show that income inequality isn&#8217;t important, we may not agree.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_196" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">196</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-90" block_type="EXP-mid">Yet other adjustments are possible. Income, in these U.S. Census Bureau figures, does not include capital gains from, for example, selling stocks that have gone up. Almost all capital gains go to the rich, so including them would widen the income gap. <em>Forbes</em> didn&#8217;t make this adjustment. Making every imaginable adjustment in the meaning of &#8220;income,&#8221; says the U.S. Census Bureau, gives the bottom fifth of households 4.7&#37; of total income in 1998 and the top fifth 45.8&#37;.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch09-p-91" block_type="EXP-mid">The gap between the highest and lowest earners continues to widen. In 2012, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the bottom fifth of households received 3.2&#37; of all income and the top fifth received 51.0&#37;.</p>

Numbers are most likely to yield insights to those who examine them properly. We need to develop &#8220;number sense,&#8221; the habit of asking if the numbers make sense.
