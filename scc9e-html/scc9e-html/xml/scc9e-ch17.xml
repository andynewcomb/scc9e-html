<p id="scc9e-ch17-p03" block_type="PO-TXTF">&#8220;<phrase block_type="drop">I</phrase>f chance will have me king, why, chance will crown me.&#8221; So said Macbeth in Shakespeare&#8217;s great play. Chance does indeed play with us all, and we can do little to understand or manage it. Sometimes, however, chance is tamed. A roll of dice, a simple random sample, even the inheritance of eye color or blood type&#8212;all represent chance tied down so that we can understand and manage it. Unlike Macbeth&#8217;s life or ours, we can roll the dice again. And again, and again. The outcomes are governed by chance, but in many repetitions a pattern emerges. Chance is no longer mysterious, because we can describe its pattern.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p05" block_type="PO-TXT">We humans use mathematics to describe regular patterns, whether the circles and triangles of geometry or the movements of the planets. We use mathematics to understand the regular patterns of chance behavior when chance is tamed in a setting where we can repeat the same chance phenomenon again and again. The mathematics of chance is called probability. Probability is the topic of this part of the book, though we will go light on the math in favor of experimenting and thinking.</p>

The Associated Press picked up the story, and it was run in newspapers around the country as an amazing feat. If birth dates are random and independent, a statistician can show that the chance that three children, selected at random, are all born on Leap Day is about 1 in 3 billion. The rarity of the event is what made the story newsworthy.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p010" block_type="TXT-ni">Chance is a slippery subject. We start by thinking about &#8220;what would happen if we did this many times.&#8221; We will also start with examples like the 1-in-2 chance of a head in tossing a coin before we try to think about more complicated situations.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p011" block_type="TXT">Even the rules of football agree that tossing a coin avoids favoritism. Favoritism in choosing subjects for a sample survey or allotting patients to treatment and placebo groups in a medical experiment is as undesirable as it is in awarding first possession of the ball in football. That&#8217;s why statisticians recommend random samples and randomized experiments, which are fancy versions of tossing a coin. A big fact emerges when we watch coin tosses or the results of random samples closely: <strong>chance behavior is unpredictable in the short run but has a regular and predictable pattern in the long run.</strong></p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p013" block_type="TXT">Toss a coin or choose a simple random sample. The result can&#8217;t be predicted in advance because the result will vary when you toss the coin or choose the sample repeatedly. But there is still a regular pattern in the results, a pattern that emerges clearly only after many repetitions. This remarkable fact is the basis for the idea of probability.</p>

For each number of tosses from 1 to 1000, we have plotted the proportion of those tosses that gave a head. The first toss was a head, so the proportion of heads starts at 1. The second toss was a tail, reducing the proportion of heads to 0.5 after two tosses. The next four tosses were tails followed by a head, so the proportion of heads after seven tosses is 2<phrase data-math="math_1"></phrase>7, or 0.286.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p016" block_type="EXP-mid">The proportion of tosses that produce heads is quite variable at first, but it settles down as we make more and more tosses.

It is not a synonym for &#8220;haphazard,&#8221; which is defined as lacking any principle of organization. We encounter the unpredictable side of randomness in our everyday experience, but we rarely see enough repetitions of the same random phenomenon to observe the long-term regularity that probability describes. You can see that regularity emerging in <link href="figure_17_1.html">Figure 17.1</link>. In the very long run, the proportion of tosses that give a head is 0.5. This is the intuitive idea of probability. Probability 0.5 means &#8220;occurs half the time in a very large number of trials.&#8221;</p>

That is, it is based on data rather than theorizing alone. Probability describes what happens in very many trials, and we must actually observe many coin tosses or many babies to pin down a probability.

The outcome of a coin toss, the time between emissions of particles by a radioactive source, and the sexes of the next litter of lab rats are all random. So is the outcome of a random sample or a randomized experiment. The behavior of large groups of individuals is often as random as the behavior of many coin tosses or many random samples. Life insurance, for example, is based on the fact that deaths occur at random among many individuals.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p034" block_type="TXT-ni">Randomness is most easily noticed in many repetitions of games of chance: rolling dice, dealing shuffled cards, spinning a roulette wheel. Chance devices similar to these have been used from remote antiquity to discover the will of the gods. The most common method of randomization in ancient times was &#8220;rolling the bones&#8221;&#8212;that is, tossing several astragali. The astragalus (<link href="figure_17_2.html">Figure 17.2</link>) is a six-sided animal heel bone that, when thrown, will come to rest on one of four sides (the other two sides are rounded). Cubical dice, made of pottery or bone, came later, but even dice existed before 2000 <phrase block_type="small">B</phrase>.<phrase block_type="small">C</phrase>. Gambling on the throw of astragali or dice is, compared with divination, almost a modern development. There is no clear record of this vice before about 300 <phrase block_type="small">B</phrase>.<phrase block_type="small">C</phrase>. Gambling reached flood tide in Roman times, then temporarily receded (along with divination) in the face of Christian displeasure.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p036" block_type="TXT">Chance devices such as astragali have been used from the beginning of recorded history. Yet none of the great mathematicians of antiquity studied the regular pattern of many throws of bones or dice. Perhaps this is because astragali and most ancient dice were so irregular that each had a different pattern of outcomes. Or perhaps the reasons lie deeper, in the classical reluctance to engage in systematic experimentation.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p037" block_type="TXT">Professional gamblers, who are not as inhibited as philosophers and mathematicians, did notice the regular pattern of outcomes of dice or cards and tried to adjust their bets to the odds of success. &#8220;How should I bet?&#8221; is the question that launched mathematical probability. The systematic study of randomness began (we oversimplify, but not too much) when seventeenth-century French gamblers asked French mathematicians for help in figuring out the &#8220;fair value&#8221; of bets on games of chance. <em>Probability theory</em>, the mathematical study of randomness, originated with Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century and was well developed by the time statisticians took it over in the twentieth century.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p038" block_type="TXT-ni">The idea of probability seems straightforward. It answers the question, &#8220;What would happen if we did this many times?&#8221; In fact, both the behavior of random phenomena and the idea of probability are a bit subtle. We meet chance behavior constantly, and psychologists tell us that we deal with it poorly.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p039" block_type="H3"><strong>The myth of short-run regularity</strong> The idea of probability is that randomness is regular <em>in the long run</em>. Unfortunately, our intuition about randomness tries to tell us that random phenomena should also be regular in the short run. When they aren&#8217;t, we look for some explanation other than chance variation.</p>

That heads and tails are equally probable says all specific outcomes of heads and tails in six tosses are equally likely. That heads and tails are equally probable says only that about half of a very long sequence of tosses will be heads. This is because in very long sequences of tosses, the number of outcomes for which the proportion of heads is approximately one-half is much larger that the number of outcomes for which the proportion is not near one-half. That heads and tails are equally probable doesn&#8217;t say that heads and tails must come close to alternating in the short run. It doesn&#8217;t say that specific outcomes that balance the number of heads and tails are more likely than specific outcomes that don&#8217;t. The coin has no memory. It doesn&#8217;t know what past outcomes were, and it can&#8217;t try to create a balanced sequence.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p045" block_type="TXT">The outcome TTTTTT in tossing six coins looks unusual because of the run of six straight tails.

If a basketball player makes several consecutive shots, both the fans and his teammates believe that he has a &#8220;hot hand&#8221; and is more likely to make the next shot. This is not supported by data. Careful study has shown that runs of baskets made or missed are no more frequent in basketball than would be expected if each shot were independent of the player&#8217;s previous shots. Players perform consistently, not in streaks. If a player makes half her shots in the long run, her hits and misses behave just like tosses of a coin&#8212;and that means that runs of hits and misses are more common than our intuition expects.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p053" block_type="TXT">Well, maybe not. It is certainly unlikely that the Pick 4 lottery would match the Ohio State versus Michigan score that day, but it is not so unlikely that sometime during the 2006 season, the winning number of some state lottery would match the recent score of some professional, college, or high school football game involving a team in the state. There are 32 NFL teams, 235 NCAA Division I teams, 150 NCAA Division II teams, and 231 NCAA Division III teams. There are also more than 25,000 high school football teams. All play a number of games during the season. There are 38 states with a Pick 3 or Pick 4 lottery game, with winning numbers often drawn multiple times per week. That&#8217;s a lot of opportunities to match a Pick 3 or Pick 4 lottery number that has digits that could conceivably be a football score like 217 or 4239.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p056" block_type="EXP-first">In 1986, Evelyn Marie Adams won the New Jersey State lottery for the second time, adding &#36;1.5 million to her previous &#36;3.9 million jackpot. The <em>New York Times</em> (February 14, 1986) claimed that the odds of one person winning the big prize twice were about 1 in 17 trillion. Nonsense, said two statistics professors in a letter that appeared in the <em>Times</em> two weeks later. The chance that Evelyn Marie Adams would win twice in her lifetime is indeed tiny, but it is almost certain that <em>someone</em> among the millions of regular lottery players in the United States would win two jackpot prizes. The statisticians estimated even odds (a probability of one-half) of another double winner within seven years. Sure enough, Robert Humphries won his second Pennsylvania lottery jackpot (&#36;6.8 million total) in May 1988. You might find it interesting to do an Internet search of &#8220;man wins state lottery two times&#8221; or &#8220;woman wins state lottery two times.&#8221; A recent double winner was a man who won the Florida State lottery for the second time on August 31, 2013.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p060" block_type="EXP-first">Between 1996 and 2013, 37 children in Clyde, Ohio, a town of 6000 halfway between Toledo and Cleveland, were diagnosed with cancer. Four of the children had died. With many of the diagnoses coming between 2002 and 2006, state health authorities declared it a cancer cluster, saying the number and type of diagnoses exceed what would be expected statistically for so small a population over that time. In the fall of 2012, the EPA found high levels of toxic, possibly cancer-causing chemical compounds in soil samples from Whirlpool Park, formerly a residential area owned by home appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corp from the 1950s until 2008. Locals told news reporters that &#8220;black sludge&#8221; had been dumped in the area during that time. However, as recently as 2009, state agencies had conducted tests in the area and found that levels of contamination were not high enough to endanger the lives of nearby residents.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p061" block_type="EXP-mid">Between 1997 and 2004, 16 children were diagnosed with cancer and three died in Fallon, Nevada, a farming community of 8300 some 60 miles southeast of Reno. This is an unusual number of cases for such a small town. Residents were concerned that perhaps high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in Fallon&#8217;s water supply, a pipeline carrying jet fuel to the local Navy base, local pesticide spraying, high tungsten levels, or an underground nuclear test conducted 30 miles away about 40 years ago might be responsible. However, scientists were unable to link any of these to the cancers. Residents were disappointed by the scientists&#8217; findings.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p062" block_type="EXP-mid">In 1984, residents of a neighborhood in Randolph, Massachusetts, counted 67 cancer cases in their 250 residences. This cluster of cancer cases seemed unusual, and the residents expressed concern that runoff from a nearby chemical plant was contaminating their water supply and causing cancer.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p063" block_type="EXP-mid">In 1979, two of the eight town wells serving Woburn, Massachusetts, were found to be contaminated with organic chemicals. Alarmed citizens began counting cancer cases. Between 1964 and 1983, 20 cases of childhood leukemia were reported in Woburn. This is an unusual number of cases of this rather rare disease. The residents believed that the well water had caused the leukemia and proceeded to sue two companies held responsible for the contamination.</p>

Then it rains on the weekend. Can there really be a statistical truth behind our perception that the weather is against us? At least on the East Coast of the United States, the answer is Yes. Going back to 1946, it seems that Sundays receive 22&#37; more precipitation than Mondays. The likely explanation is that the pollution from all those workday cars and trucks forms the seeds for raindrops&#8212;with just enough delay to cause rain on the weekend.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p066" block_type="TXT">Cancer is a common disease, accounting for more than 23&#37; of all deaths in the United States. That cancer cases sometimes occur in clusters in the same neighborhood is not surprising; there are bound to be clusters <em>somewhere</em> simply by chance. But when a cancer cluster occurs in <em>our</em> neighborhood, we tend to suspect the worst and look for someone to blame. State authorities get several thousand calls a year from people worried about &#8220;too much cancer&#8221; in their area. But the National Cancer Institute finds that the majority of reported cancer clusters are simply the result of chance.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p067" block_type="TXT">Both of the Massachusetts cancer clusters were investigated by statisticians from the Harvard School of Public Health. The investigators tried to obtain complete data on everyone who had lived in the neighborhoods in the periods in question and to estimate their exposure to the suspect drinking water. They also tried to obtain data on other factors that might explain cancer, such as smoking and occupational exposure to toxic substances. The verdict: chance is the likely explanation of the Randolph cluster, but there is evidence of an association between drinking water from the two Woburn wells and developing childhood leukemia.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p068" block_type="TXT"><strong>The myth of the law of averages</strong> Roaming the gambling floors in Las Vegas, watching money disappear into the drop boxes under the tables, is revealing. You can see some interesting human behavior in a casino. When the shooter in the dice game craps rolls several winners in a row, some gamblers think she has a &#8220;hot hand&#8221; and bet that she will keep on winning. Others say that &#8220;the law of averages&#8221; means that she must now lose so that wins and losses will balance out. Believers in the law of averages think that if you toss a coin six times and get TTTTTT, the next toss must be more likely to give a head. It&#8217;s true that in the long run heads must appear half the time. What is myth is that future outcomes must make up for an imbalance like six straight tails.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p069" block_type="TXT">Coins and dice have no memories. A coin doesn&#8217;t know that the first six outcomes were tails, and it can&#8217;t try to get a head on the next toss to even things out. Of course, things do even out <em>in the long run</em>. After 10,000 tosses, the results of the first six tosses don&#8217;t matter. They are overwhelmed by the results of the next 9994 tosses, not compensated for.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p072" block_type="EXP-first">Belief in this phony &#8220;law of averages&#8221; can lead to consequences close to disastrous. A few years ago, &#8220;Dear Abby&#8221; published in her advice column a letter from a distraught mother of eight girls. It seems that she and her husband had planned to limit their family to four children. When all four were girls, they tried again&#8212;and again, and again. After seven straight girls, even her doctor had assured her that &#8220;the law of averages was in our favor 100 to 1.&#8221; Unfortunately for this couple, having children is like tossing coins. Eight girls in a row is highly unlikely, but once seven girls have been born, it is not at all unlikely that the next child will be a girl&#8212;and it was.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p073" block_type="TXT"><strong>What is the law of averages?</strong> Is there a &#8220;law of averages&#8221;? There is, although it is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;law of large numbers.&#8221; It states that in a large number of &#8220;independent&#8221; repetitions of a random phenomenon (such as coin tossing), averages or proportions are likely to become more stable as the number of trials increases, whereas sums or counts are likely to become more variable. This does not happen by compensation for a run of bad luck because, by &#8220;independent,&#8221; we mean that knowing the outcome of one trial does not change the probabilities for the outcomes of any other trials. The trials have no memory.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p074" block_type="TXT"><link href="figure_17_1.html">Figure 17.1</link> and <link href="figure_17_3.html">17.3</link> show what happens when we toss a coin repeatedly many times. In <link href="figure_17_1.html">Figure 17.1</link>, we see that the <em>proportion</em> of heads gradually becomes closer and closer to 0.5 as the number of tosses increases. This illustrates the law of large numbers. However, <link href="figure_17_3.html">Figure 17.3</link> shows, for these same tosses, how far the <em>total</em> number of heads differs from exactly half of the tosses being heads. We see that this difference varies more and more as the number of tosses increases. The law of large numbers does not apply to sums or counts.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p075" block_type="TXT">It is not uncommon to see the law of averages misstated in terms of the sums or counts rather than means or proportions. For example, assuming that the birthrates for boys and girls in the United States are equal, you may hear someone state that the <em>total</em> number of males and females in the United States should be nearly equal rather than stating that the <em>proportion</em> of males and females in the United States should be nearly equal.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p078" block_type="TXT-ni">Joe sits staring into his beer as his favorite baseball team, the Chicago Cubs, loses another game. The Cubbies have some good young players, so let&#8217;s ask Joe, &#8220;What&#8217;s the chance that the Cubs will go to the World Series next year?&#8221; Joe brightens up. &#8220;Oh, about 10&#37;,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p079" block_type="TXT">Does Joe assign probability 0.10 to the Cubs&#8217; appearing in the World Series? The outcome of next year&#8217;s pennant race is certainly unpredictable, but we can&#8217;t reasonably ask what would happen in many repetitions. Next year&#8217;s baseball season will happen only once and will differ from all other seasons in players, weather, and many other ways. The answer to our question seems clear: if probability measures &#8220;what would happen if we did this many times,&#8221; Joe&#8217;s 0.10 is not a probability. Probability is based on data about many repetitions of the same random phenomenon. Joe is giving us something else, his personal judgment.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p080" block_type="TXT">Yet we often use the term &#8220;probability&#8221; in a way that includes personal judgments of how likely it is that some event will happen. We make decisions based on these judgments&#8212;we take the bus downtown because we think the probability of finding a parking spot is low. More serious decisions also take judgments about likelihood into account. A company deciding whether to build a new plant must judge how likely it is that there will be high demand for its products three years from now when the plant is ready. Many companies express &#8220;How likely is it?&#8221; judgments as numbers&#8212;probabilities&#8212;and use these numbers in their calculations. High demand in three years, like the Cubs&#8217; winning next year&#8217;s pennant, is a one-time event that doesn&#8217;t fit the &#8220;do it many times&#8221; way of thinking. What is more, several company officers may give several different probabilities, reflecting differences in their individual judgment. We need another kind of probability, <em>personal probability</em>.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p082" block_type="BX1-T">Personal probability</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p083" block_type="BX1-TXT-ni">A <strong>personal probability</strong> of an outcome is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses an individual&#8217;s judgment of how likely the outcome is.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p084" block_type="TXT">Personal probabilities have the great advantage that they aren&#8217;t limited to repeatable settings. They are useful because we base decisions on them: &#8220;I think the probability that the Patriots will win the Super Bowl is 0.75, so I&#8217;m going to bet on the game.&#8221; Just remember that personal probabilities are different in kind from probabilities as &#8220;proportions in many repetitions.&#8221; Because they express individual opinion, they can&#8217;t be said to be right or wrong.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p085" block_type="TXT">This is true even in a &#8220;many repetitions&#8221; setting. If Craig has a gut feeling that the probability of a head on the next toss of this coin is 0.7, that&#8217;s what Craig thinks and that&#8217;s all there is to it. Tossing the coin many times may show that the proportion of heads is very close to 0.5, but that&#8217;s another matter. <strong>There is no reason a person&#8217;s degree of confidence in the outcome of one try must agree with the results of many tries.</strong> We stress this because it is common to say that &#8220;personal probability&#8221; and &#8220;what happens in many trials&#8221; are somehow two interpretations of the same idea. In fact, they are quite different ideas.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p086" block_type="TXT">Why do we even use the word &#8220;probability&#8221; for personal opinions? There are two good reasons. First, we usually do base our personal opinions on data from many trials when we have such data. Data from Buffon, Pearson, and Kerrich (<link href="example_17_2.html">Example 2</link>) and perhaps from our own experience convince us that coins come up heads very close to half the time in many tosses. When we say that a coin has probability one-half of coming up heads <em>on this toss</em>, we are applying to a single toss a measure of the chance of a head based on what would happen in a long series of tosses. Second, personal probability and probability as long-term proportion both obey the same mathematical rules. Both kinds of probabilities are numbers between 0 and 1. We will look at more of the rules of probability in the next chapter. These rules apply to both kinds of probability.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_417" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">417</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p088" block_type="TXT">Although &#8220;personal probability&#8221; and &#8220;what happens in many trials&#8221; are different ideas, what happens in many trials often causes us to revise our personal probability of an event. If Craig has a gut feeling that the probability of a head when he tosses a particular coin is 0.7, that&#8217;s what Craig thinks. If he tosses it 20 times and gets nine heads, he may continue to believe that the probability of heads is 0.7&#8212;because personal probabilities need not agree with the results of many trials. But he may also decide to revise his personal probability downward based on what he has observed. Is there a sensible way to do this, or is this also just a matter of personal opinion?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch17-p089" block_type="TXT">In statistics, there are formal methods for using data to adjust personal probabilities. These are called <em>Bayes&#8217;s procedures</em>. The basic rule, called <em>Bayes&#8217;s theorem</em>, is attributed to the Reverend Thomas Bayes, who discussed the rule in &#8220;An Essay towards Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances&#8221; published in 1764. The mathematics is somewhat complicated, and we will not discuss the details. However, the use of Bayes&#8217;s procedures is becoming increasingly common among practitioners.</p>

Such opinions are not always correct. The previous exercise asked you to spin a nickel rather than toss it&#8212;that changes the probability of a head. Now try another variation. Stand a nickel on edge on a hard, flat surface. Pound the surface with your hand so that the nickel falls over. What is the probability that it falls with heads upward?

He makes 90.0&#37; of his free throws. In today&#8217;s game, Curry misses his first two free throws. The TV commentator says, &#8220;Curry&#8217;s technique looks out of rhythm today.&#8221; Explain why the claim that Curry&#8217;s technique has deteriorated is not justified.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p0182" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">17.26 In the long run.</phrase> Probability works not by compensating for imbalances but by overwhelming them. Suppose that the first 10 tosses of a coin give 10 tails and that tosses after that are exactly half heads and half tails. (Exact balance is unlikely, but the example illustrates how the first 10 outcomes are swamped by later outcomes.) What is the proportion of heads after the first 10 tosses? What is the proportion of heads after 100 tosses if half of the last 90 produce heads (45 heads)? What is the proportion of heads after 1000 tosses if half of the last 990 produce heads? What is the proportion of heads after 10,000 tosses if half of the last 9990 produce heads?</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch17-p0193" block_type="CR-X-NL"><phrase block_type="CR-X-NL-N-ri">17.32 What probability doesn&#8217;t say.</phrase> The probability of a head in tossing a coin is 1-in-2. This means that as we make more tosses, the <em>proportion</em> of heads will eventually get close to 0.5. It does not mean that the <em>count</em> of heads will get close to one-half the number of tosses. To see why, imagine that the proportion of heads is 0.49 in 100 tosses, 0.493 in 1000 tosses, 0.4969 in 10,000 tosses, and 0.49926 in 100,000 tosses of a coin. How many heads came up in each set of tosses? How close is the number of heads to half the number of tosses?</p>
