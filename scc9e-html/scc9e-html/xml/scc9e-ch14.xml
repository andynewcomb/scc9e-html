Best places to live, best colleges, healthiest foods, worst-dressed women . . . a list of best or worst is sure to find a place in the news. When the state-by-state SAT scores come out each year, it&#8217;s therefore no surprise that we find news articles ranking the states from best (North Dakota in 2014) to worst (District of Columbia in 2014) according to the <termref term="average">average</termref> Mathematics SAT score achieved by their high school seniors. Unfortunately, such reports leave readers believing that schools in the District of Columbia must be much worse than those in North Dakota. Where does your home state rank? And do you believe the ranking reflects the quality of education you received?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">The College Board, which sponsors the SAT exams, doesn&#8217;t like this practice at all. &#8220;Comparing or ranking states on the basis of SAT scores alone is invalid and strongly discouraged by the College Board,&#8221; says the heading on their table of state average SAT scores. To see why, let&#8217;s look at the data.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-06" block_type="BX4-TXT-I"><link href="figure_14_1.html">Figure 14.1</link> shows the <termref term="distribution">distribution</termref> of average scores on the SAT Mathematics exam for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. North Dakota leads at 620, and the District of Columbia trails at 438 on the SAT scale of 200 to 800. The distribution has an unusual <termref term="shape">shape</termref>: it has one clear peak and perhaps a second, small one. This may be a clue that the data mix two distinct groups. But, we need to explore the data further to be sure that this is the case.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-07" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">In this chapter, we will learn that to understand one <termref term="variable">variable</termref>, such as SAT scores, we must look at how it is related to other variables. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use what you have learned to understand why <link href="figure_14_1.html">Figure 14.1</link> has such an unusual shape and to appreciate why the College Board discourages ranking states on SAT scores alone.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-010" block_type="TXT-ni">A medical study finds that short women are more likely to have heart attacks than women of average height, while tall women have the fewest heart attacks. An insurance group reports that heavier cars are involved in fewer fatal accidents per 10,000 vehicles registered than are lighter cars. These and many other statistical studies look at the relationship between two variables. To understand such a relationship, we must often examine other variables as well. To conclude that shorter women have higher risk from heart attacks, for example, the researchers had to eliminate the effect of other variables such as weight and exercise habits. Our topic in this and the following chapters is relationships between variables. One of our main themes is that the relationship between two variables can be strongly influenced by other variables that are lurking in the background.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-011" block_type="TXT">Most statistical studies examine data on more than one variable. Fortunately, statistical analysis of several-variable data builds on the tools we used to examine individual variables. The principles that guide our work also remain the same:</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-018" block_type="EXP-first">How did the universe begin? One popular theory is known as the &#8220;Big Bang.&#8221; The universe began with a big bang and matter expanded outward, like a balloon inflating. If the Big Bang theory is correct, galaxies farthest away from the origin of the bang must be moving faster than those closest to the origin. This also means that galaxies close to the earth must be moving at a similar speed to that of earth, and galaxies far from earth must be moving at very different speeds from earth. Hence, relative to earth, the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be moving away from earth. Are data consistent with this theory? The answer is Yes.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-019" block_type="EXP-mid">In 1929, Edwin Hubble investigated the relationship between the distance from the earth and the recession velocity (the speed at which an object is moving away from an observer) of galaxies. Using data he had collected, Hubble estimated the distance, in megaparsecs, from the earth to 24 galaxies. One parsec equals 3.26 light-years (the distance light travels in one year), and a megaparsec is one million parsecs. The recession velocities, in kilometers per second, of the galaxies were also measured. <link href="figure_14_2.html">Figure 14.2</link> is a scatterplot that shows how recession velocity is related to distance from the earth. We think that &#8220;distance from the earth&#8221; will help explain &#8220;recession velocity.&#8221; That is, &#8220;distance from the earth&#8221; is the <em><termref term="explanatory variable">explanatory variable</termref></em>, and &#8220;recession velocity&#8221; is the <em><termref term="response variable">response variable</termref></em>. We want to see how recession velocity changes when distance from the earth changes, so we put distance from the earth (the explanatory <termref term="variable">variable</termref>) on the horizontal axis. We can then see that, as distance from the earth goes up, recession velocity goes up. Each point on the plot represents one galaxy. For example, the point with a different plotting symbol corresponds to a galaxy that is 1.7 megaparsecs from the earth and that has a recession velocity of 960 kilometers per second.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch14-p-020" block_type="EXP-mid">Hubble&#8217;s discovery turned out to be one of the most important discoveries in all of astronomy. The data helped establish Hubble&#8217;s law, which is recession velocity = <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> &#215; Distance, where <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> is the value known as the Hubble constant. Hubble&#8217;s law says that the apparent recession velocities of galaxies are directly proportional to their distances. This relationship is the key evidence for the idea of the expanding universe, as suggested by the Big Bang.</p>

Straight-line relations are particularly important because a straight line is a simple pattern that is quite common. A straight-line relation is strong if the points lie close to a straight line and weak if they are widely scattered about a line. Our eyes are not good judges of how strong a relationship is. The two scatterplots in <link href="figure_14_6.html">Figure 14.6</link> depict the same data, but the right-hand plot is drawn smaller in a large field. The right-hand plot seems to show a stronger straight-line relationship.
