Climate scientists warn us that major changes will occur in the coming years. For example, scientists predict that the changing climate will probably bring more rain to California, but they don&#8217;t know whether the additional rain will come during the winter wet season or extend into the long dry season in spring and summer. Is it possible to investigate the effects of possible future changes in climate now?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-04" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley carried out an experiment to study the effects of more rain in either season. They randomly assigned plots of open grassland to three treatments. One treatment was to add water equal to 20&#37; of annual rainfall during January to March (winter). A second treatment was to add water equal to 20&#37; of annual rainfall during April to June (spring). The third treatment was to add no water beyond normal rainfall. Eighteen circular plots of area 70 square meters were used for this study, with six plots used for each treatment. One variable the researchers measured was total plant biomass, in grams per square meter, produced in a plot over a year. Total plant biomass for the three treatments was compared to assess the effect of increased rainfall.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-20" block_type="TXT-ni">Do students who take a course via the Web learn as well as those who take the same course in a traditional classroom? The best way to find out is to assign some students to the classroom and others to the Web. That&#8217;s an experiment. The Nova Southeastern University study was not an experiment because it imposed no treatment on the student subjects. Students chose for themselves whether to enroll in a classroom or an online version of a course. The study simply measured their learning. It turns out that the students who chose the online course were very different from the classroom students. For example, their average score on a test on the course material given before the courses started was 40.70, against only 27.64 for the classroom students. It&#8217;s hard to compare in-class versus online learning when the online students have a big head start. The effect of online versus in-class instruction is hopelessly mixed up with influences lurking in the background. <link href="figure_5_1.html">Figure 5.1</link> shows the mixed-up influences in picture form.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-27" block_type="EXP-mid">Experiments that study the effectiveness of medical treatments on actual patients are called <strong>clinical trials</strong>. The clinical trial that suggested that a drink made from pig whipworm eggs might be effective in relieving the symptoms of Crohn&#8217;s disease had a &#8220;one-track&#8221; design&#8212;that is, only a single treatment was applied:</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-28" block_type="EXP-mid"><strong>Impose treatment</strong> &#8594; <strong>Measure response</strong></p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-29" block_type="EXP-mid"><strong>Pig whipworms</strong> &#8594; <strong>Reduced symptoms?</strong></p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-30" block_type="EXP-mid">The patients did report reduced symptoms, but we can&#8217;t say that the pig whipworm treatment caused the reduced symptoms. It might be just the <strong>placebo effect</strong>. A <strong>placebo</strong> is a dummy treatment with no active ingredients. Many patients respond favorably to <em>any</em> treatment, even a placebo. This response to a dummy treatment is the placebo effect. Perhaps the placebo effect is in our minds, based on trust in the doctor and expectations of a cure. Perhaps it is just a name for the fact that many patients improve for no visible reason. The one-track design of the experiment meant that the placebo effect was confounded with any effect the pig whipworm drink might have.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-31" block_type="EXP-mid">The researchers recognized this and urged further study with a better-designed experiment. Such an experiment might involve dividing subjects with Crohn&#8217;s disease into two groups. One group would be treated with the pig whipworm drink as before. The other would receive a placebo. Subjects in both groups would not know which treatment they were receiving. Nor would the physicians recording the symptoms of the subjects know which treatment a subject received so that their diagnosis would not be influenced by such knowledge. An experiment in which neither subjects nor physicians recording the symptons know which treatment was received is called <strong>double-blind</strong>.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-32" block_type="TXT">Both observational studies and one-track experiments often yield useless data because of confounding with lurking variables. It is hard to avoid confounding when only observation is possible. Experiments offer better possibilities, as the pig whipworm experiment shows. This experiment could be designed to include a group of subjects who receive only a placebo. This would allow us to see whether the treatment being tested does better than a placebo and so has more than the placebo effect going for it. Effective medical treatments pass the &#8220;placebo test&#8221; by outperforming a placebo.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-33" block_type="TXT-ni">The first goal in designing an experiment is to ensure that it will show us the effect of the explanatory variables on the response variables. Confounding often prevents one-track experiments from doing this. The remedy is to <em>compare</em> two or more treatments. When confounding variables affect all subjects equally, any systematic differences in the responses of subjects receiving different treatments can be attributed to the treatments rather than to the confounding variables. This is the idea behind the use of a placebo. All subjects are exposed to the placebo effect because all receive some treatment. Here is an example of a new medical treatment that passes the placebo test in a direct comparison.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-35" block_type="EXP-first">Sickle-cell anemia is an inherited disorder of the red blood cells that in the United States affects mostly blacks. It can cause severe pain and many complications. The National Institutes of Health carried out a clinical trial of the drug hydroxyurea for treatment of sickle-cell anemia. The subjects were 299 adult patients who had had at least three episodes of pain from sickle-cell anemia in the previous year. An episode of pain was defined to be a visit to a medical facility that lasted more than four hours for acute sickling-related pain. The measurement of the length of the visit included all time spent after registration at the medical facility, including the time spent waiting to see a physician.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-36" block_type="EXP-mid">Simply giving hydroxyurea to all 299 subjects would confound the effect of the medication with the placebo effect and other lurking variables such as the effect of knowing that you are a subject in an experiment. Instead, approximately half of the subjects received hydroxyurea, and the other half received a placebo that looked and tasted the same. All subjects were treated exactly the same (same schedule of medical checkups, for example) except for the content of the medicine they took. Lurking variables, therefore, affected both groups equally and should not have caused any differences between their average responses.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-39" block_type="TXT"><link href="figure_5_2.html">Figure 5.2</link> illustrates the simplest <strong>randomized comparative experiment</strong>, one that compares just two treatments. The diagram outlines the essential information about the design: random assignment to groups, one group for each treatment, the number of subjects in each group (it is generally best to keep the groups similar in size), what treatment each group gets, and the response variable we compare. Random assignment of subjects to groups can use any of the techniques discussed in <link href="scc9e-ch02.xml">Chapter 2</link>. For example, we could choose a simple random sample, labeling the 299 subjects 1 to 299, then using software to select the 152 subjects for Group 1. The remaining 147 subjects form Group 2. Lacking software, label the 299 subjects 001 to 299 and read three-digit groups from the table of random digits (<link href="table_a.html">Table A</link>) until you have chosen the 152 subjects for Group 1.

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-40" block_type="TXT">The placebo group in <link href="example_5_4.html">Example 4</link> is called a <strong>control group</strong> because comparing the treatment and control groups allows us to control the effects of lurking variables.

In <link href="example_5_2.html">Example 2</link>, the students who were randomly assigned to the session providing access to brochures on sexual assault (as was common university practice) were considered to be a control group. Clinical trials often compare a new treatment for a medical condition&#8212;not with a placebo, but with a treatment that is already on the market. Patients who are randomly assigned to the existing treatment form the control group. To compare more than two treatments, we can randomly assign the available experimental subjects to as many groups as there are treatments. Here is an example with three groups.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-47" block_type="TXT-ni">The randomized comparative experiment is one of the most important ideas in statistics. It is designed to allow us to draw cause-and-effect conclusions. Be sure you understand the logic:</p>
<list id="scc9e-ch05-list-01" type="unordered" block_type="bluebullet">

This ensures that any additional lurking variables operate equally on all groups and, on average, that groups differ only in the treatments they receive.</p></li>
<li id="scc9e-ch05-li-03"><p id="scc9e-ch05-p-50" block_type="BL-last"><phrase block_type="maker">&#8226;</phrase> Therefore, differences in the response variable must be due to the effects of the treatments.</p></li>
</list>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-51" block_type="TXT">We use chance to choose the groups in order to eliminate any systematic bias in assigning the subjects to groups. In the sickle-cell study, for example, a doctor might subconsciously assign the most seriously ill patients to the hydroxyurea group, hoping that the untested drug will help them. That would bias the experiment against hydroxyurea. Choosing an SRS of the subjects to be Group 1 gives everyone the same chance to be in either group. We expect the two groups to be similar in all respects&#8212;age, seriousness of illness, smoker or not, and so on. Chance tends to assign equal numbers of smokers to both groups, for example, even if we don&#8217;t know which subjects are smokers.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-52" block_type="TXT">What about the effects of lurking variables not addressed by randomization&#8212;for example, those that arise after subjects have been randomly assigned to groups? The placebo effect is such a lurking variable. Its effect occurs only after the treatments are administered to subjects. If the groups are treated at different times of the year, so that some groups are treated during flu season and others not, higher exposure of some groups to the flu could be a lurking variable. In a comparative design, we try to ensure that these lurking variables operate similarly on all groups. All groups receive some treatment in order to ensure they are equally exposed to the placebo effect. All groups receive treatment at the same time, so all experience the same exposure to the flu.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_102" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">102</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-53" block_type="TXT">It may not surprise you to learn that medical researchers adopted randomized comparative experiments only slowly&#8212;many doctors think they can tell &#8220;just by watching&#8221; whether a new therapy helps their patients. Not so. There are many examples of medical treatments that became popular on the basis of one-track experiments and were shown to be worth no more than a placebo when some skeptic tried a randomized comparative experiment. One search of the medical literature looked for therapies studied both by proper comparative trials and by trials with &#8220;historical controls.&#8221; A study with historical controls compares the results of a new treatment, not with a control group, but with how well similar patients have done in the past. Of the 56 therapies studied, 44 came out winners with respect to historical controls. But only 10 passed the placebo test in proper randomized comparative experiments. Expert judgment is too optimistic even when aided by comparison with past patients. At present, U.S. law requires that new drugs be shown to be both safe and effective by randomized comparative trials. There is no such requirement for other medical treatments, such as surgery. A Web search of &#8220;comparisons with historical controls&#8221; found recent studies for other medical treatments that have used historical controls.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-54" block_type="TXT">There is one important caution about randomized experiments. Like random samples, they are subject to the laws of chance. Just as an SRS of voters might, by bad luck, choose people nearly all of whom have the same political party preference, a random assignment of subjects might, by bad luck, put nearly all the smokers in one group. We know that if we choose <em>large</em> random samples, it is very likely that the sample will match the population well. In the same way, if we use <em>many</em> experimental subjects, it is very likely that random assignment will produce groups that match closely. More subjects means that there is less chance variation among the treatment groups and less chance variation in the outcomes of the experiment. &#8220;Use enough subjects&#8221; joins &#8220;compare two or more treatments&#8221; and &#8220;randomize&#8221; as a basic principle of statistical design of experiments.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-60" block_type="TXT-ni">The presence of chance variation requires us to look more closely at the logic of randomized comparative experiments. We cannot say that <em>any</em> difference in the average number of pain episodes between the hydroxyurea group and the control group must be due to the effect of the drug. Even if both treatments are the same, there will always be some chance differences between the individuals in the control group and those in the treatment group. Randomization eliminates just the systematic differences between the groups.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-62" block_type="BX1-TXT-ni">An observed effect of a size that would rarely occur by chance is called <strong>statistically significant</strong>.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-63" block_type="TXT">The difference between the average number of pain episodes for subjects in the hydroxyurea group and the average for the control group was &#8220;highly statistically significant.&#8221; That means that a difference of this size would almost never happen just by chance. We do indeed have strong evidence that hydroxyurea beats a placebo in helping sickle-cell disease sufferers. You will often see the phrase &#8220;statistically significant&#8221; in reports of investigations in many fields of study. It tells you that the investigators found good &#8220;statistical&#8221; evidence for the effect they were seeking.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-64" block_type="TXT">Of course, the actual results of an experiment are more important than the seal of approval given by statistical significance. The treatment group in the sickle-cell experiment had an average of 2.5 pain episodes per year as opposed to 4.5 per year in the control group. That&#8217;s a big enough difference to be important to people with the disease. A difference of 2.5 versus 2.8 would be much less interesting even if it were statistically significant.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-65" block_type="TXT">How large an observed effect must be in order to be regarded as statistically significant depends on the number of subjects involved. A relatively small effect&#8212;one that might not be regarded as practically important&#8212;can be statistically significant if the size of the study is large. Thus, in the sickle-cell experiment, an average of 2.50 pain episodes per year versus 2.51 per year in the control group could be statistically significant if the number of subjects involved is sufficiently large. For a very large number of subjects, the average number of pain episodes per year should be almost the same if differences are due only to chance. It is also true that a very large effect may not be statistically significant. If the number of subjects in an experiment is small, it may be possible to observe large effects simply by chance. We will discuss these issues more fully in Parts III and IV.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-66" block_type="TXT">Thus, in assessing statistical significance, it is helpful to know the magnitude of the observed effect and the number of subjects. Perhaps a better term than &#8220;statistically significant&#8221; might be &#8220;statistically dissimilar.&#8221;</p>

<section-metadata><section-title>How to live with observational studies</section-title></section-metadata>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-67" block_type="TXT-ni">Do children who are bullied suffer depression as adults? Do doctors discriminate against women in treating heart disease? Does texting while driving increase the risk of having an accident? These are cause-and-effect questions, so we reach for our favorite tool, the randomized comparative experiment. Sorry. We refuse to require children to be bullied. We can&#8217;t use random digits to assign heart disease patients to be men or women. We are reluctant to require drivers to use cell phones in traffic because talking while driving may be risky.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-68" block_type="TXT">The best data we have about these and many other cause-and-effect questions come from observational studies. We know that observation is a weak second-best to experiment, but good observational studies are far from worthless, and we will discuss this further in <link href="scc9e-ch15.xml">Chapter 15</link>. What makes a good observational study?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-69" block_type="TXT">First, good studies are <strong>comparative</strong> even when they are not experiments. We compare random samples of people who were bullied as children with those who were not bullied. We compare how doctors treat men and women patients. We might compare drivers talking on cell phones with the <em>same</em> drivers when they are not on the phone. We can often combine comparison with <strong>matching</strong> in creating a control group. To see the effects of taking a painkiller during pregnancy, we compare women who did so with women who did not. From a large pool of women who did not take the drug, we select individuals who match the drug group in age, education, number of children, and other lurking variables. We now have two groups that are similar in all these ways so that these lurking variables should not affect our comparison of the groups. However, if other important lurking variables, not measurable or not thought of, are present, they will affect the comparison, and confounding will still be present.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-70" block_type="TXT">Matching does not entirely eliminate confounding. People who were bullied as children may have characteristics that increase susceptibility to victimization as well as independently increasing the risk of depression. They are more likely to be female, have had concurrent emotional or mental health problems as a child, have parents who suffer from depression, or have experienced maltreatment at home as a child. Although matching can reduce some of these differences, direct comparison of rates of depression in young adults who were bullied as children and in young adults who were not bullied as children would still confound any effect of bullying with the effects of mental health issues in childhood, mental health issues of the parents, and maltreatment as a child. A good comparative study <strong>measures and adjusts for confounding variables</strong>. If we measure sex, the presence of mental health issues as a child, the presence of mental health issues in the parents, and aspects of the home environment, there are statistical techniques that reduce the effects of these variables on rates of depression so that (we hope) only the effect of bullying itself remains.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-71" block_type="EXP-T"><phrase block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 6</phrase> Bullying and depression</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-72" block_type="EXP-first">A recent study in the United Kingdom examined data on 3898 participants in a large observational study for which they had information on both victimization by peers at age 13 and the presence of depression at age 18. The researchers also had information on lots of variables, not just the explanatory variable (bullying at age 13) and the response variable (presence of depression at age 18). The research article said:</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-73" block_type="EXP-ul"><em>Compared with children who were not victimized those who were frequently victimized by peers had over a twofold increase in the odds of depression</em>. . . . <em>This association was slightly reduced when adjusting for confounders</em>. . .</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-74" block_type="EXP-first">That &#8220;adjusting for confounders&#8221; means that the final results were adjusted for differences between the two groups. Adjustment reduced the association between bullying at age 13 and depression at age 18, but still left a nearly twofold increase in the odds of depression.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-75" block_type="EXP-mid">Interestingly, the researchers go on to mention that the use of observational data does not allow them to conclude the associations are causal.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-77" block_type="EXP-first">Doctors are less likely to give aggressive treatment to women with symptoms of heart disease than to men with similar symptoms. Is this because doctors are sexist? Not necessarily. Women tend to develop heart problems much later than men so that female heart patients are older and often have other health problems. That might explain why doctors proceed more cautiously in treating them.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_106" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">106</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-78" block_type="EXP-mid">This is a case for a comparative study with statistical adjustments for the effects of confounding variables. There have been several such studies, and they produce conflicting results. Some show, in the words of one doctor, &#8220;When men and women are otherwise the same and the only difference is gender, you find that treatments are very similar.&#8221; Other studies find that women are undertreated even after adjusting for differences between the female and male subjects.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-79" block_type="TXT">As <link href="example_5_7.html">Example 7</link> suggests, statistical adjustment is complicated. Randomization creates groups that are similar in <em>all</em> variables known and unknown. Matching and adjustment, on the other hand, can&#8217;t work with variables the researchers didn&#8217;t think to measure. Even if you believe that the researchers thought of everything, you should be a bit skeptical about statistical adjustment. There&#8217;s lots of room for cheating in deciding which variables to adjust for. And the &#8220;adjusted&#8221; conclusion is really something like this:</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-80" block_type="UL-first"><em>If female heart disease patients were younger and healthier than they really are, and if male patients were older and less healthy than they really are, then the two groups would get the same medical care.</em></p>
<p id="scc9e-ch05-p-81" block_type="TXT-ni">This may be the best we can get, and we should thank statistics for making such wisdom possible. But we end up longing for the clarity of a good experiment.</p>

Researchers used ultrasound to measure the carotid artery wall thickness of 1483 people living near freeways in the Los Angeles area. The artery wall thickness among those living within 100 meters of a highway increased by 5.5 micrometers (roughly 1 / 20th the thickness of a human hair) each year during the three-year study, which is more than twice the progression observed in participants who did not live within this distance of a highway.</p>

Using statistical analysis, the researchers found that for cardiovascular disease, those born in the fall (September through December) were more protected, while those born in winter and spring (January to June) had higher risk. And because so many lives are cut short due to cardiovascular diseases, being born in the autumn was actually associated with living longer than being born in the spring.

Researchers at two universities studied this issue. In one of the studies, 65 students listened to five talks. Students were randomly assigned either a laptop or a notebook for purposes of taking notes. Assume that 33 students were assigned to use laptops and 32 longhand. Whether taking notes on a laptop or by hand in a notebook, students were instructed to use their normal note-taking strategy. Thirty minutes after the lectures, participants were tested with conceptual application questions based on the lectures. Those taking notes by hand performed better than those taking notes on a laptop. Why is instructing students to use their normal note-taking strategy a problem if the goal is to determine the effect on learning of note-taking on a laptop as compared to note-taking by hand?</p>

The two treatments are traditional surgery and a new method that does not require surgery. The records described many patients whose doctors had chosen one or the other method. The study found that patients treated by the new method were significantly more likely to die within eight years.</p>

A nutrition experimenter intends to compare the weight gain of prematurely born infants fed Diet A with those fed Diet B. To do this, she will feed each diet to 10 prematurely born infants whose parents have enrolled them in the study. She has available 10 baby girls and 10 baby boys. The researcher is concerned that baby boys may respond more favorably to the diets, so if all the baby boys were fed Diet A, the experiment would be biased in favor of Diet A.</p>
