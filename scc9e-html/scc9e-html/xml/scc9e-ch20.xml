The probability of winning tells you what proportion of a large number of bets will be winners. You care even more about <em>how much</em> you will win because winning a lot is better than winning a little.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">There are a lot of ways to gamble. You can play games, like some of the multistate lotteries, that have enormous jackpots but very small probabilities of winning. You can play games like roulette for which the probability of winning is much larger than for a multistate lottery, but with smaller jackpots. Which is the better gamble: an enormous jackpot with extremely small odds or a modest jackpot with more reasonable odds?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p06" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">In this chapter, you will learn about expected values. Expected values provide one way to compare games of chance that have huge jackpots but small chances of winning with games with more modest jackpots but more reasonable chances of winning. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to determine whether buying a multistate lottery ticket or simply playing red in roulette is a better bet.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p07" block_type="TXT-ni">Gambling on chance outcomes goes back to ancient times and has continued throughout history. Both public and private lotteries were common in the early years of the United States. After disappearing for a century or so, government-run gambling reappeared in 1964, when New Hampshire caused a furor by introducing a lottery to raise public revenue without raising taxes. The furor subsided quickly as larger states adopted the idea. Forty-two states and all Canadian provinces now sponsor lotteries. State lotteries made gambling acceptable as entertainment. Some form of legal gambling is allowed in 48 of the 50 states. More than half of all adult Americans have gambled legally. They spend more betting than on spectator sports, video games, theme parks, and movie tickets combined. If you are going to bet, you should understand what makes a bet good or bad. As our introductory Case Study says, we care about how much we win as well as about our probability of winning.</p>

New Jersey&#8217;s Pick 3 game is typical: the state pools the money bet and pays out half of it, equally divided among the winning tickets. You still have probability 1-in-1000 of winning a Straight bet, but the amount your number 123 wins depends both on how much was bet on Pick 3 that day and on how many other players chose the number 123.

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p045" block_type="TXT">The law of large numbers explains why gambling, which is a recreation or an addiction for individuals, is a business for a casino. The &#8220;house&#8221; in a gambling operation is not gambling at all. The average winnings of a large number of customers will be quite close to the expected value. The house has calculated the expected value ahead of time and knows what its take will be in the long run. There is no need to load the dice or stack the cards to guarantee a profit. Casinos concentrate on inexpensive entertainment and cheap bus trips to keep the customers flowing in. If enough bets are placed, the law of large numbers guarantees the house a profit. Life insurance companies operate much like casinos&#8212;they bet that the people who buy insurance will not die. Some do die, of course, but the insurance company knows the probabilities and relies on the law of large numbers to predict the average amount it will have to pay out. Then the company sets its premiums high enough to guarantee a profit.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p047" block_type="TXT-ni">As with probability, it is worth exploring a few fine points about expected values and the law of large numbers.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p048" block_type="H3"><strong>How large is a large number?</strong> The law of large numbers says that the actual average outcome of many trials gets closer to the expected value as more trials are made. It doesn&#8217;t say how many trials are needed to guarantee an average outcome close to the expected value. That depends on the <em>variability</em> of the random outcomes.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p049" block_type="TXT">The more variable the outcomes, the more trials are needed to ensure that the mean outcome is close to the expected value. Games of chance must be quite variable if they are to hold the interest of gamblers. Even a long evening in a casino has an unpredictable outcome. Gambles with extremely variable outcomes, like state lottos with their very large but very improbable jackpots, require impossibly large numbers of trials to ensure that the average outcome is close to the expected value. (The state doesn&#8217;t rely on the law of large numbers&#8212;most lotto payoffs, unlike casino games, use the pari-mutuel system. In a pari-mutuel system, payoffs and payoff odds are determined by the actual amounts bet. In state lottos, for example, the payoffs are determined by the total amount bet after the state removes its share. In horse racing, payoff odds are determined by the relative amounts bet on the different horses.)</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_471" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">471</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p051" block_type="TXT">Though most forms of gambling are less variable than the lotto, the practical answer to the applicability of the law of large numbers is that the expected value of the winnings for the house is positive and the house plays often enough to rely on it. Your problem is that the expected value of your winnings is negative. As a group, gamblers play as often as the house. Because their expected value is negative, as a group they lose money over time. However, this loss is not spread evenly among the many individual gamblers. Some win big, some lose big, and some break even. Much of the psychological allure of gambling is its unpredictability for the player. The business of gambling rests on the fact that the result is not unpredictable for the house.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p054" block_type="BX3-TXT-ni">Most voters think that some forms of gambling should be legal, and the majority has its way: lotteries and casinos are common both in the United States and in other nations. The arguments in favor of allowing gambling are straightforward. Many people find betting entertaining and are willing to lose a bit of money in exchange for some excitement. Gambling doesn&#8217;t harm other people, at least not directly. A democracy should allow entertainments that a majority supports and that don&#8217;t do harm. State lotteries raise money for good causes such as education and are a kind of voluntary tax that no one is forced to pay.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p056" block_type="H3"><strong>Is there a winning system?</strong> Serious gamblers often follow a system of betting in which the amount bet on each play depends on the outcome of previous plays. You might, for example, double your bet on each spin of the roulette wheel until you win&#8212;or, of course, until your fortune is exhausted. Such a system tries to take advantage of the fact that you have a memory even though the roulette wheel does not. Can you beat the odds with a system? No. Mathematicians have established a stronger version of the law of large numbers that says that if you do not have an infinite fortune to gamble with, your average winnings (the expected value) remain the same as long as successive trials of the game (such as spins of the roulette wheel) are independent. Sorry.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p058" block_type="TXT-ni">How can we calculate expected values in practice? You know the mathematical recipe, but that requires that you start with the probability of each outcome. Expected values that are too difficult to compute in this way can be found by simulation. The procedure is as before: give a probability model, use random digits to imitate it, and simulate many repetitions. By the law of large numbers, the average outcome of these repetitions will be close to the expected value.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p060" block_type="EXP-first">A couple plan to have children until they have a girl or until they have three children, whichever comes first. We simulated 10 repetitions of this scheme in <link href="example_19_4.html">Example 4</link> of <link href="scc9e-ch19.xml">Chapter 19</link> (page 452). There, we estimated the probability that they will have a girl among their children. Now we ask a different question: how many children, on the average, will couples who follow this plan have? That is, we want the expected number of children.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p061" block_type="EXP-mid">The simulation is exactly as before. The probability model says that the sexes of successive children are independent and that each child has probability 0.49 of being a girl. Here are our earlier simulation results&#8212;but rather than noting whether the couple did have a girl, we now record the number of children they have. Recall that a pair of digits simulates one child, with 00 to 48 (probability 0.49) standing for a girl.</p>

When the wheel is spun, the ball is equally likely to come to rest in any of the slots. Gamblers bet on roulette by placing chips on a table that lays out the numbers and colors of the 38 slots in the roulette wheel. The red and black slots are arranged on the table in three columns of 12 slots each. A &#36;1 column bet wins &#36;3 if the ball lands in one of the 12 slots in that column. What is the expected amount such a bet wins? If you did the Case Study Evaluated, is a column bet more or less favorable to a gambler than a bet on red or black (see <link href="scc9e-ch20-p074">Question 1</link> in the Case Study Evaluated on page 473)?</p>

By the same reasoning, if we have <em>n</em> trials with probability <em>p</em> of a hit on each trial, the expected number of hits is <em>np</em>. This fact can be proved mathematically. Can we verify it by simulation?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch20-p0164" block_type="CR-X-NL">Simulate 10 tosses of a fair coin 50 times. (To do this quickly, use the first 10 digits in each of the 50 rows of <link href="table_a.html">Table A</link>, with odd digits meaning a head and even digits a tail.) What is the expected number of heads by the <em>np</em> formula? What is the mean number of heads in your 50 repetitions?</p>

In fact, casinos keep a bit over 20&#37; of the money gamblers spend on roulette chips. That&#8217;s because players who win keep on playing. Think of a player who gets back exactly 95&#37; of each dollar bet. After one bet, he has 95 cents.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch20-p0168" block_type="CR-X-NL">Notice that the longer he keeps recycling his original dollar, the more of it the casino keeps. Real gamblers don&#8217;t get a fixed percentage back on each bet, but even the luckiest will lose his stake if he plays long enough. The casino keeps 5.3 cents of every dollar bet but 20 cents of every dollar that walks in the door.</p>
