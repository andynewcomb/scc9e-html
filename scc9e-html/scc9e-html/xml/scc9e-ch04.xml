<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-05" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Most polls are taken by telephone, dialing numbers at random to get a random sample of households. After eliminating fax and business numbers, Pew had to call 2879 residential numbers to get its sample of 1000 people. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-06" block_type="BX4-TXT-I">Out of 2879 working residential phone numbers, 33&#37; never answered. Of those who answered, 24&#37; refused to talk.

Pew called every number five times over a five-day period, at different times of day and on different days of the week. Many polls call only once, and it is usual to find that more than half of those who answer refuse to talk. Although Pew did obtain the desired sample of 1000 people, can we trust the results of this poll to make conclusions about people with residential phones? Can the results of the poll be extended to people who only have cell phones? By the end of this chapter, you will learn how to answer this question.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-18" block_type="TXT">If the sampling frame leaves out certain classes of people, even random samples from that frame will be biased. Using telephone directories as the frame for a telephone survey, for example, would miss everyone with an unlisted residential telephone number, everyone who cannot afford a residential phone, and everyone who has only a cell phone. Even if we consider only those with residential telephones, more than half the households in many large cities have unlisted numbers, so massive undercoverage and <termref term="bias">bias</termref> against urban areas would result. In fact, telephone surveys use random digit dialing equipment, which dials telephone numbers in selected regions at random. In effect, the sampling frame contains all residential telephone numbers.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-20" block_type="EXP-first">Most opinion polls can&#8217;t afford even to attempt full coverage of the population of all adult residents of the United States. The interviews are done by telephone, thus missing the 2&#37; of households without phones. Only <em>households</em> are contacted, so students in dormitories, prison inmates, and most members of the armed forces are left out. So are the homeless and people staying in shelters. Many polls interview only in English, which leaves some immigrant households out of their samples.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-21" block_type="TXT">The kinds of undercoverage found in most sample surveys are most likely to leave out people who are young or poor or who move often. Nonetheless, random digit dialing comes close to producing a random sample of households with phones. Sampling errors in careful sample surveys are usually quite small. The real problems start when someone picks up (or doesn&#8217;t pick up) the phone. Now <termref term="nonsampling errors">nonsampling errors</termref> take over.</p>

They include <strong>processing errors</strong>&#8212;mistakes in mechanical tasks such as doing arithmetic or entering responses into a computer.

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-25" block_type="EXP-first">The days of the interviewer with a clipboard are past. Contemporary interviewers carry a laptop computer for face-to-face interviews or watch a computer screen as they carry out a telephone interview. Computer software manages the interview. The interviewer reads questions from the computer screen and uses the keyboard to enter the responses. The computer skips irrelevant items&#8212;once a respondent says that she has no children, further questions about her children never appear. The computer can check that answers to related questions are consistent with each other. It can even present questions in <termref term="random">random</termref> order to avoid any <termref term="bias">bias</termref> due to always asking questions in the same order.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-26" block_type="EXP-mid">Computer software also manages the record keeping. It keeps records of who has responded and prepares a file of data from the responses. The tedious process of transferring responses from paper to computer, once a source of processing errors, has disappeared. The computer even schedules the calls in telephone surveys, taking account of the respondent&#8217;s time zone and honoring appointments made by people who were willing to respond but did not have time when first called.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-27" block_type="TXT">Another type of nonsampling error is <strong><termref term="response error">response error</termref></strong>, which occurs when a subject gives an incorrect response. A subject may lie about her age or income or about whether she has used illegal drugs. She may remember incorrectly when asked how many packs of cigarettes she smoked last week. A subject who does not understand a question may guess at an answer rather than appear ignorant. Questions that ask <termref term="subjects">subjects</termref> about their behavior during a fixed time period are notoriously prone to response errors due to faulty memory. For example, the National Health Survey asks people how many times they have visited a doctor in the past year. Checking their responses against health records found that they failed to remember 60&#37; of their visits to a doctor. A survey that asks about sensitive issues can also expect response errors, as the next example illustrates.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-30" block_type="EXP-first">In 1989, New York City elected its first black mayor and the state of Virginia elected its first black governor. In both cases, samples of voters interviewed as they left their polling places predicted larger margins of victory than the official vote counts. The polling organizations were certain that some voters lied when interviewed because they felt uncomfortable admitting that they had voted against the black candidate. This phenomenon is known as &#8220;social desirability <termref term="bias">bias</termref>&#8221; and &#8220;the Bradley effect,&#8221; after Tom Bradley, the former black mayor of Los Angeles who lost the 1982 California gubernatorial election despite leading in final-day preelection polls.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-31" block_type="EXP-mid">This effect attracted media attention during the 2008 presidential election. A few weeks before the election, polls predicted a victory, possibly a big one, for Barack Obama. Even so, Democrats worried that these polls might be overly optimistic because of the Bradley effect. In this case their fears were unfounded, but some political scientists claimed to detect the Bradley effect in polls predicting outcomes in primary races between Barack Obama and Hilary Clinton (for example, in the New Hampshire primary, polls predicted an 8 percentage point Obama victory, but Clinton won by 3 percentage points).</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-32" block_type="TXT-ni">Technology and attention to detail can minimize processing errors.

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-35" block_type="TXT-ni">Nonresponse is the most serious problem facing sample surveys. People are increasingly reluctant to answer questions, particularly over the phone.

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-37" block_type="EXP-T"><phrase block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 4</phrase> How bad is nonresponse?</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-38" block_type="EXP-first">The U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s American Community Survey (ACS) is a monthly survey of almost 300,000 housing units and replaced the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s &#8220;long form&#8221; that, in the past, was sent to some households in the every-10-years national census. Participation in the ACS is mandatory, and the U.S. Census Bureau follows up by telephone and then in person if a household fails to return the mail questionnaire.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-39" block_type="EXP-mid">The ACS has the lowest nonresponse <termref term="rate">rate</termref> of any poll we know: in 2013, only about 1.3&#37; of the households in the sample refused to respond; the overall nonresponse rate, including &#8220;never at home&#8221; and other causes, was 10.1&#37;. This is a stark contrast in nonresponse from previous years&#8212;in 2012, the total nonresponse rate was only 2.7&#37;. In October 2013, there was a government shutdown. During that time, &#8220;the ACS did not have a second mailing, a telephone followup, or a person followup operation for the October 2013 housing unit panel. . . . This caused a drop in the annual housing unit response rate of about 7 percentage points.&#8221; If October 2013 is excluded from the ACS when considering nonresponse, the total nonresponse rate for 2013 was only 2.9&#37;, similar to previous years.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-40" block_type="EXP-mid">Another survey that has a remarkable response rate is the University of Chicago&#8217;s General Social Survey (GSS), the nation&#8217;s most important social survey. The GSS (<link href="example_1_7.html">Example 7</link> in <link href="scc9e-ch01.xml">Chapter 1</link>) contacts its sample in person, and it is run by a university. Despite these advantages, its recent surveys have a 30&#37; rate of nonresponse.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-41" block_type="EXP-mid">What about polls done by the media and by market research and opinion-polling firms? We often don&#8217;t know their rates of nonresponse because they won&#8217;t say. That itself is a bad sign. The Pew poll we looked at in the Case Study suggests how bad things are. Pew got 1221 responses (of whom 1000 were in the <termref term="population">population</termref> they targeted) and 1658 who were never at home, refused, or would not finish the interview. That&#8217;s a nonresponse rate of 1658 out of 2879, or 58&#37;. The Pew researchers were more thorough than many pollsters. Insiders say that nonresponse often reaches 75&#37; or 80&#37; of an opinion poll&#8217;s original sample.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-42" block_type="EXP-mid">The situation investigated in the Case Study was more promising than a recent Pew survey. In a December 2013 survey on social media use, the Pew Research <termref term="Center">Center</termref> provided a full disposition of the sampled phone numbers. Here are the details. Initially, 40,985 landline and 27,000 cell phones were dialed, with 11,260 of the landlines and 15,758 of the cell numbers being working numbers. Of these 27,018 working numbers, they were able to contact 17,335, or about 64&#37;, as a large portion of the calls went to voicemail. Among those contacted, about 15&#37; cooperated. Of those cooperating, some numbers were ineligible due to language barriers or contacting a child&#8217;s cell phone, and some calls were eventually broken off without being completed. To sum it up, the 27,018 working numbers dialed resulted in a final sample of 1801, giving a response rate of about 7&#37;, an estimate of the fraction of all <em>eligible</em> respondents in the sample who were ultimately interviewed.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-44" block_type="TXT">Sample surveyors know some tricks to reduce nonresponse. Carefully trained interviewers can keep people on the line if they answer at all. Calling back over longer time periods helps. So do letters sent in advance. Letters and many callbacks slow down the survey, so opinion polls that want fast answers to satisfy the media don&#8217;t use them. Even the most careful surveys find that nonresponse is a problem that no amount of expertise can fully overcome. That makes this reminder even more important:</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-48" block_type="TXT">Does nonresponse make many sample surveys useless? Maybe not. We began this chapter with an account of a &#8220;standard&#8221; telephone survey done by the Pew Research Center. The Pew researchers also carried out a &#8220;rigorous&#8221; survey, with letters sent in advance, unlimited calls over eight weeks, letters by priority mail to people who refused, and so on. All this drove the rate of nonresponse down to 30&#37;, compared with 58&#37; for the standard survey. Pew then compared the answers to the same questions from the two surveys. The two samples were quite similar in age, sex, and race, though the rigorous sample was a bit more prosperous. The two samples also held similar opinions on all issues except one: race. People who at first refused to respond were less sympathetic toward the plights of blacks and other minorities than those who were willing to respond when contacted the first time. Overall, it appears that standard polls give reasonably accurate results. But, as in <link href="example_4_3.html">Example 3</link>, race is again an exception.</p>

The <em>Washington Post</em>/ABC News survey said, &#8220;The AP reported classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts and prosecutors have obtained AP&#8217;s phone records through a court order. Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified?&#8221; Fifty-two (52&#37;) of respondents to this survey said that the action of federal prosecutors was justified.</p>

Additionally, the difference in wording&#8212;&#8220;decision to subpoena&#8221; in the Pew Research survey versus &#8220;obtained . . . through a court order&#8221; used by the <em>Washington Post</em>/ABC News survey&#8212;could have led to legitimizing the actions of the Department of Justice and thus a higher &#8220;approval&#8221; for the Justice Department&#8217;s actions. Or, was the higher justification based on the inclusion of the mention of U.S. antiterrorism efforts? Or, perhaps the difference is due to Pew using &#8220;the Justice Department&#8221; and the <em>Washington Post</em>/ABC News using &#8220;federal prosecutors.&#8221; We cannot begin to determine which part of the wording affected the responses. As the Pew Research Center said in its article comparing the results of these two surveys, &#8220;each polling organization made good-faith efforts to describe the facts of the situation as accurately as possible, but the word choices and context make it impossible to identify one particular phrase or concept that tipped the public's thinking.&#8221;</p>

If the questions are slanted to favor one response over others, we have another source of nonsampling error. A favorite trick is to ask if the subject favors some policy as a means to a desirable end: &#8220;Do you favor banning private ownership of handguns in order to reduce the <termref term="rate">rate</termref> of violent crime?&#8221; and &#8220;Do you favor imposing the death penalty in order to reduce the rate of violent crime?&#8221; are loaded questions that draw positive responses from people who are worried about crime.

What should a careful <termref term="sample survey">sample survey</termref> do about this? First, <strong>substitute other households</strong> for the nonresponders. Because nonresponse is higher in cities, replacing nonresponders with other households in the same neighborhood may reduce <termref term="bias">bias</termref>. Once the data are in, all professional surveys use statistical methods to <strong>weight the responses</strong> in an attempt to correct sources of <termref term="bias">bias</termref>. If many urban households did not respond, the survey gives more weight to those that did respond. If too many women are in the <termref term="sample">sample</termref>, the survey gives more weight to the men. Here, for example, is part of a statement in the <em>New York Times</em> describing one of its sample surveys:</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-68" block_type="EXT-TXT"><em>The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age and education.</em></p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-69" block_type="TXT-ni">The goal is to get results &#8220;as if&#8221; the sample matched the <termref term="population">population</termref> in age, gender, place of residence, and other variables.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-70" block_type="TXT">The practice of weighting creates job opportunities for statisticians. It also means that the results announced by a sample survey are rarely as simple as they seem to be. Gallup announces that it interviewed 1523 adults and found that 57&#37; of them bought a lottery ticket in the last 12 months. It would seem that because 57&#37; of 1523 is 868, Gallup found that 868 people in its sample had played the lottery. Not so. Gallup no doubt used some quite fancy statistics to weight the actual responses: 57&#37; is Gallup&#8217;s best estimate of what it would have found in the absence of nonresponse. Weighting does help correct bias. It usually also increases <termref term="variability">variability</termref>. The announced <termref term="margin of error">margin of error</termref> must take this into account, creating more work for statisticians.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-74" block_type="EXP-first">The population that the Current Population Survey (CPS) is interested in consists of all households in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii). The sample is <strong>chosen in stages</strong>. The <termref term="Census">Census</termref> Bureau divides the nation into 2007 geographic areas called primary sampling units (PSUs). These are generally groups of neighboring counties. At the first stage, 754 PSUs are chosen. This isn&#8217;t an SRS. If all PSUs had the same chance to be chosen, the sample might miss Chicago and Los Angeles. So 428 highly populated PSUs are automatically in the sample. The other 1579 are divided into 326 groups, called <strong><termref term="strata">strata</termref></strong>, by combining PSUs that are similar in various ways. One PSU is chosen at <termref term="random">random</termref> to represent each stratum.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-75" block_type="EXP-mid">Each of the 754 PSUs in the first-stage sample is divided into census blocks (smaller geographic areas). The blocks are also grouped into strata, based on such things as housing types and minority population. The households in each <termref term="block">block</termref> are arranged in order of their location and divided into groups, called <strong>clusters</strong>, of about four households each. The final sample consists of samples of clusters (not of individual households) from each stratum of blocks. Interviewers go to all households in the chosen clusters. The samples of clusters within each stratum of blocks are also not SRSs. To be sure that the clusters spread out geographically, the sample starts at a random <termref term="cluster">cluster</termref> and then takes, for example, every 10th cluster in the list.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-76" block_type="TXT">The design of the CPS illustrates several ideas that are common in real-world samples that use face-to-face interviews. Taking the sample <em>in several stages</em> with <em>clusters</em> at the final stage saves travel time for interviewers by grouping the sample households first in PSUs and then in clusters. Note that clustering is not an aspect of all sampling strategies, but it can be quite helpful in situations like the CPS.</p>

Second, a stratified sample usually has a smaller <termref term="margin of error">margin of error</termref> than an SRS of the same size.

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-104" block_type="EXP-T"><phrase block_type="EXP-N-ri">EXAMPLE 9</phrase> The woes of telephone samples</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-105" block_type="EXP-first">In principle, it would seem that a telephone survey that dials numbers at random could be based on an SRS. Telephone surveys have little need for clustering. Stratifying can still reduce variability, however, and so telephone surveys often take samples in two stages: a stratified sample of telephone number prefixes (area code plus first three digits) followed by individual numbers (last four digits) dialed at random in each prefix.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-106" block_type="EXP-mid">The real problem with an SRS of telephone numbers is that too few numbers lead to households. Blame technology. Fax machines, modems, and cell phones demand new phone numbers. Between 1988 and 2008, the number of households in the United States grew by 29&#37;, but the number of possible residential phone numbers grew by more than 120&#37;. Some analysts believe that, in the near future, we may have to increase the number of digits for telephone numbers from 10 (including the area code) to 12. This will further exacerbate this problem. Telephone surveys now use &#8220;list-assisted samples&#8221; that check electronic telephone directories to eliminate prefixes that have no listed numbers before random sampling begins. Fewer calls are wasted, but anyone living where all numbers are unlisted is missed. Prefixes with no listed numbers are, therefore, separately sampled (stratification again), perhaps with a smaller sample size than if included in the list-assisted sample, to fill the gap.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_76" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">76</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-108" block_type="EXP-mid">The proliferation of cell phones has created additional problems for telephone samples. As of December 2013, about 41&#37; of households had cell phones only. Random digit dialing using a machine is not allowed for cell phone numbers. Phone numbers assigned to cell phones are determined by the location of the cell phone company providing the service and need not coincide with the actual residence of the user. This makes it difficult to implement sophisticated methods of sampling such as stratified sampling by geographic location.</p>
</box>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-109" block_type="TXT">It may be that the woes of telephone sampling prompted the Gallup Organization, in recent years, to drop the phrase &#8220;random sampling&#8221; from the description of their survey methods at the end of most of their polls. This presumably prevents misinterpreting the results as coming from simple random samples. In the organization&#8217;s detailed description of survey methods used for the Gallup World Poll and the Gallup Well-Being Index (available online at the Gallup website), the samples are described as involving random sampling.</p>

<section-metadata><section-title>The challenge of Internet surveys</section-title></section-metadata>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-110" block_type="TXT-ni">The Internet is having a profound effect on many things people do, and this includes surveys. Using the Internet to conduct &#8220;Web surveys&#8221; is becoming increasingly popular. Web surveys have several advantages over more traditional survey methods. It is possible to collect large amounts of survey data at lower costs than traditional methods allow. Anyone can put survey questions on dedicated sites offering free services; thus, large-scale data collection is available to almost every person with access to the Internet. Furthermore, Web surveys allow one to deliver multimedia survey content to respondents, opening up new realms of survey possibilities that would be extremely difficult to implement using traditional methods. Some argue that eventually Web surveys will replace traditional survey methods.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-111" block_type="TXT">Although Web surveys are easy to do, they are not easy to do well. The reasons include many of the issues we have discussed in this chapter. Three major problems are voluntary response, <termref term="undercoverage">undercoverage</termref>, and <termref term="nonresponse">nonresponse</termref>. Voluntary response appears in several forms. Some Web surveys invite visitors to a particular website to participate in a poll. Misterpoll.com is one such example. Visitors to this site can participate in several ongoing polls, create their own poll, and respond multiple times to the same poll. Other Web surveys solicit participation through announcements in newsgroups, email invitations, and banner ads on high-traffic sites. An example is a series of 10 polls conducted by Georgia Tech University&#8217;s Graphic, Visualization, and Usability <termref term="Center">Center</termref> (GVU) in the 1990s.</p>
<p id="scc9e_page_77" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="right">77</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-113" block_type="TXT">Although misterpoll.com indicates that the surveys on the site are primarily intended for entertainment, the GVU polls appear to claim some measure of legitimacy. The website <link href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user&#95;surveys/">www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/user&#95;surveys/</link> states that the information from these surveys &#8220;is valued as an <termref term="independent">independent</termref>, objective view of developing Web demographics, culture, user attitudes, and usage patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-114" block_type="TXT">A third and more sophisticated example of voluntary response occurs when the polling organization creates what it believes to be a representative panel consisting of volunteers and uses panel members as a <termref term="sampling frame">sampling frame</termref>. A <termref term="random">random</termref> <termref term="sample">sample</termref> is selected from this panel, and those selected are invited to participate in the poll. A very sophisticated version of this approach is used by the Harris Poll Online.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-115" block_type="TXT">Web surveys, such as the Harris Poll Online, in which a random sample is selected from a well-defined sampling frame are reasonable when the sampling frame clearly represents some larger <termref term="population">population</termref> or when interest is only in the members of the sampling frame. An example are Web surveys that use systematic sampling to select every <em>n</em>th visitor to a site and the target population is narrowly defined as visitors to the site. Another example are some Web surveys on college campuses. All students may be assigned email addresses and have Internet access. A list of these email addresses serves as the sampling frame, and a random sample is selected from this list. If the population of interest is all students at this particular college, these surveys can potentially yield very good results. Here is an example of this type of Web survey.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-120" block_type="TXT">Several other Web survey methods have been employed to eliminate problems arising from voluntary response. One is to use the Web as one of many alternative ways to participate in the survey. The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. <termref term="Census">Census</termref> Bureau have used this method. Another method is to select random samples from panels, but instead of relying on volunteers to form the panels, members are recruited using random sampling (for example, random digit dialing). Telephone interviews can be used to collect background information, identify those with Internet access, and recruit eligible persons to the panel. If the target population is current users of the Internet, this method should also potentially yield reliable results. The Pew Research Center has employed this method.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-121" block_type="TXT">Perhaps the most ambitious approach, and one that attempts to obtain a random sample from a more general population, is the following. Take a <termref term="probability sample">probability sample</termref> from the population of interest. Provide all those selected with the necessary equipment and tools to participate in subsequent Web surveys. This methodology is similar in spirit to that used for the Nielsen TV ratings. It was employed by one company, InterSurvey, several years ago, although InterSurvey is no longer in business.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-122" block_type="TXT">Several challenges remain for those who employ Web surveys. Even though Internet and email use is growing (according to the 2012 <em>Statistical Abstract of the United States</em>, as of 2010, 80&#37; of American adults aged 18 and older have Internet access at home or work, and 71&#37; have Internet access at home), there is still the problem of undercoverage if Web surveys are used to draw conclusions about all American adults aged 18 and older. Weighting responses to correct for possible biases does not solve the problem because studies indicate that Internet users differ in many ways that traditional methods of weighting do not account for.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-123" block_type="TXT">In addition, even if 100&#37; of Americans had Internet access, there is no list of Internet users that we can use as a sampling frame, nor is there anything comparable to random digit dialing that can be used to draw random samples from the collection of all Internet users.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-124" block_type="TXT">Finally, Web surveys often have very high rates of nonresponse. Methods that are used in phone and mail surveys to improve response rates can help, but they make Web surveys more expensive and difficult, offsetting some of their advantages.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-127" block_type="BX3-TXT-ni">The Harris Poll Online has created an online research panel of more than 6 million volunteers. According to the Harris Poll Online website, the &#8220;panel consists of a diverse cross-section of people residing in the United States, as well as in over 200 countries around the world,&#8221; and &#8220;this multimillion member panel consists of potential respondents who have been recruited through online, telephone, mail, and in-person approaches to increase population coverage and enhance representativeness.&#8221; One can join the panel at <link href="http://www.join.harrispollonline.com">join.harrispollonline.com</link>.</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-129" block_type="BX3-TXT">When the Harris Poll Online conducts a survey, this panel serves as the sampling frame. A <termref term="probability">probability</termref> sample is selected from it, and statistical methods are used to weight the responses. In particular, the Harris Poll Online uses propensity score weighting, a proprietary Harris Interactive technique, which is also applied (when applicable) to adjust for respondents&#8217; likelihood of being online. They claim that &#8220;this procedure provides added assurance of accuracy and representativeness.&#8221;</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-135" block_type="TXT-ni">It&#8217;s clear from <link href="example_4_7.html">Examples 7</link>, <link href="example_4_8.html">8</link>, and <link href="example_4_9.html">9</link>, and from the challenges of using the Internet to conduct surveys, that designing samples is a business for experts. Even most statisticians don&#8217;t qualify. We won&#8217;t worry about such details. The big idea is that good <termref term="sample">sample</termref> designs use chance to select <termref term="individuals">individuals</termref> from the <termref term="population">population</termref>. That is, all good samples are <em><termref term="probability">probability</termref> samples</em>.</p>

<p id="scc9e_page_80" block_type="page_start" data-margin-content="left">80</p>
<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-140" block_type="TXT-ni">A stratified sample of 300 undergraduate students and 200 graduate students, for example, allows only samples with exactly that makeup. An SRS would allow any 500 students. Both are probability samples. We need only know that estimates from any probability sample share the nice properties of estimates from an SRS. Confidence statements can be made without <termref term="bias">bias</termref> and have smaller margins of error as the size of the sample increases. Nonprobability samples such as voluntary response samples do not share these advantages and cannot give trustworthy information about a population. Now that we know that most nationwide samples are more complicated than an SRS, we will usually go back to acting as if good samples were SRSs. That keeps the big idea and hides the messy details.</p>

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-141" block_type="TXT-ni">Opinion polls and other <termref term="sample">sample</termref> surveys can produce accurate and useful information if the pollster uses good statistical techniques and also works hard at preparing a <termref term="sampling frame">sampling frame</termref>, wording questions, and reducing <termref term="nonresponse">nonresponse</termref>. Many surveys, however, especially those designed to influence public opinion rather than just record it, do not produce accurate or useful information.

<p id="scc9e-ch04-p-151" block_type="TXT-ni">Academic survey centers and <termref term="government statistical offices">government statistical offices</termref> answer these questions when they announce the results of a sample survey. National opinion polls usually don&#8217;t announce their response rate (which is often low) but do give us the other information. Editors and newscasters have the bad habit of cutting out these dull facts and reporting only the sample results. Many sample surveys by interest groups and local newspapers and TV stations don&#8217;t answer these questions because their polling methods are, in fact, unreliable. If a politician, an advertiser, or your local TV station announces the results of a poll without complete information, be skeptical.</p>

In some cases, more complex probability samples, such as stratified samples, can help correct nonsampling errors.
